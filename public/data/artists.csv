His most famous work, possibly the only genuine survival, is the Thirteen Emperors Scroll. He also painted the Portraits at Lingyan Pavilion, under Emperor Taizong of Tang, commissioned in 643 to commemorate 24 of the greatest contributors to Emperor Taizong's reign, as well as 18 portraits commemorating the 18 great scholars who served Emperor Taizong when he was the Prince of Qin. Yan's paintings included painted portraits of various Chinese emperors from the Han dynasty (202 BC–220 AD) up until the Sui dynasty (581–618) period. His works were highly regarded by the Tang writers Zhu Jingxuan and Zhang Yanyuan, who noted his paintings were ""works among the glories of all times"". From the years 669 to 673, Yan Liben also served as a chancellor under Emperor Taizong's son Emperor Gaozong (r. 649–683). A record of 1120 gives 42 titles of Yan's paintings, though the Thirteen Emperors Scroll is not among them. Only four Buddhist subjects are listed, against 12 Daoist. The remainder are portraits, ""gods of the planets and constellations"" or records of events at court. Of the surviving works attributed to him, the Thirteen Emperors Scroll is ""the first that is generally accepted as being partly original"", though much of it seems later. A similar figure of an emperor in fresco in the Mogao Caves (Cave 200), might be by the same hand, and carries the appropriate date of 642. By tradition the reliefs of the six favourite horses at the mausoleum of Emperor Taizong (d. 649) were designed by Yan Liben, and the relief is so flat and linear that it seems likely they were carved after drawings or paintings.

fan-kuan,Fan Kuan,范宽|范寬|Kuan,"Fan Zhongzheng (c. 960 – c. 1030), courtesy name Zhongli, better known by his pseudonym Fan Kuan (Chinese: 范寬; pinyin: Fàn Kuān; Wade–Giles: Fan K’uan), was a Chinese landscape painter of the Song dynasty. He was both a Daoist and a Neo-Confucianist. Travelers among Mountains and Streams, a large hanging scroll, is Fan Kuan's best known work, possibly his only surviving one, and a seminal painting of the Northern Song school. It establishes an ideal in monumental landscape painting to which later painters were to return time and again for inspiration. The classic Chinese perspective of three planes is evident - near, middle (represented by water and mist), and far. Unlike earlier examples of Chinese landscape art, the grandeur of nature is the main theme, rather than merely providing a backdrop. A packhorse train can barely be seen emerging from a wood at the base of a towering precipice. The painting's style encompasses archaic conventions dating back to the Tang dynasty. The historian Patricia Ebrey explains her view on the painting that the: ...foreground, presented at eye level, is executed in crisp, well-defined brush strokes. Jutting boulders, tough scrub trees, a mule train on the road, and a temple in the forest on the cliff are all vividly depicted. There is a suitable break between the foreground and the towering central peak behind, which is treated as if it were a backdrop, suspended and fitted into a slot behind the foreground. There are human figures in this scene, but it is easy to imagine them overpowered by the magnitude and mystery of their surroundings. Fan's masterpiece Travellers among Mountains and Streams bears a lost half-hidden signature rediscovered only in 1958.",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c2/Fan_Kuan_-_Travelers_Among_Mountains_and_Streams_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg/960px-Fan_Kuan_-_Travelers_Among_Mountains_and_Streams_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg,China,960,1030,Northern Song Landscape Painting,Travelers among Mountains and Streams|Snowy Woods|Immortals in the Mountains (attributed),https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fan_Kuan
guo-xi,Guo Xi,郭熙,"Guo Xi (Chinese: 郭熙; pinyin: Guō Xī; Wade–Giles: Kuo Hsi) (c. 1020 – c. 1090) was a Chinese landscape painter from Henan Province who lived during the Northern Song dynasty. One text entitled ""The Lofty Message of Forest and Streams"" (Linquan Gaozhi 林泉高致) is attributed to him. The work covers a variety of themes centered on the appropriate way of painting a landscape. He was a court professional, a literatus, well-educated painter who developed an incredibly detailed system of idiomatic brushstrokes which became important for later painters. One of his most famous works is Early Spring, dated 1072. The work demonstrates his innovative techniques for producing multiple perspectives which he called ""the angle of totality."" This type of visual representation is also called ""Floating Perspective"", a technique which displaces the static eye of the viewer and highlights the differences between Chinese and Western modes of spatial representation. The following is an excerpt from his treatise, ""mountains and waters"": The clouds and the vapours of real landscapes are not the same at the four seasons. In spring they are light and diffused, in summer rich and dense, in autumn scattered and thin, in winter dark and solitary. When such effects can be seen in pictures, the clouds and vapours have an air of life. The mist around the mountains is not the same at the four seasons. The mountains in spring are light and seductive as if smiling: the mountains in summer have a blue-green colour which seems to be spread over them; the mountains in autumn are bright and tidy as if freshly painted; the mountains in winter are sad and tranquil as if sleeping. Another painting that can be attributed to him is The Coming of Autumn. Both paintings capture the seasonal atmosphere and are regarded as important accomplishments of the Song Dynasty. Guo Xi was often referred to as a ""Northern Song master"" when it came to painting. His work inspired many later artists and he even had landscapes dedicated to him. His lesser-known ""Deep Valley"" scroll painting depicts a serene mountain valley covered with snow and several trees struggling to survive on precipitous cliffs. The ink washes and amorphous brush strokes are employed to model surfaces that suggest the veiling effects of the atmosphere. One of Guo Xi’s techniques was to layer ink washes to build up forms and his ""Deep Valley"" is a masterpiece of the use of light ink and magnificent composition. His son later described how Guo Xi approached his work: ""On days when he was going to paint, he would seat himself at a clean table, by a bright window, burning incense to right and left. He would choose the finest brushes, the most exquisite ink; wash his hands, and clean the ink-stone, as though he were expecting a visitor of rank. He waited until his mind was calm and undisturbed, and then began.""",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/86/Guo_Xi_-_Early_Spring_%28large%29.jpg/960px-Guo_Xi_-_Early_Spring_%28large%29.jpg,China,1020,1090,Northern Song Landscape Painting,"Early Spring|Clearing Autumn Skies over Mountains and Valleys|Old Trees, Level Distance",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guo_Xi

He was also a very well-known painter, poet and calligrapher. Born as the 11th son of Emperor Shenzong, he ascended the throne in 1100 upon the death of his elder brother and predecessor, Emperor Zhezong, because Emperor Zhezong's only son died prematurely. He lived in luxury, sophistication and art in the first half of his life. In 1126, when the Jurchen-led Jin dynasty invaded the Song dynasty during the Jin–Song Wars, Emperor Huizong abdicated and passed on his throne to his eldest son, Zhao Huan while Huizong assumed the honorary title of Taishang Huang (or ""Retired Emperor""). The following year, the Song capital, Bianjing, was conquered by Jin forces in an event historically known as the Jingkang Incident. Emperor Huizong and Emperor Qinzong and the rest of their family were taken captive by the Jurchens and brought back to the Jin capital, Huining Prefecture in 1128. The Emperor Taizong of Jin, gave the former Emperor Huizong a title, Duke Hunde (literally ""Besotted Duke""), to humiliate him. After Zhao Gou, the only surviving son of Huizong to avoid capture by the Jin, declared himself as the dynasty's tenth emperor as Emperor Gaozong, the Jurchens used Huizong, Qinzong, and other imperial family members to put pressure on Gaozong and his court to surrender. Emperor Huizong died in Wuguocheng after spending about nine years in captivity. He, along with his successors, were blamed for the Song dynasty's decline. Although he wasn't a competent administrator, Emperor Huizong was known for his promotion of Taoism and talents in poetry, painting, calligraphy and music.

He was also known as Madman Liang because of his very informal pictures. He was born in Shandong and worked in Lin An (later Hangzhou). He is known to have studied with the master Jia Shigu. He was awarded the rank of Painter-in-Attendance at the court of Jia Tai (1201-1204 CE, Southern Song Dynasty) where he was known for mastery in painting figures, landscapes, and other minor subjects. He was also awarded the Golden Belt, however he left it behind when he left his position at court to practise Chan Buddhism.",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a0/Huineng_Cut_Bamboo.jpg,China,1140,1210,Southern Song Chan Painting,Li Bai Chanting a Poem (Tokyo National Museum)|Sixth Patriarch Chopping Bamboo|Sakyamuni Descending the Mountain,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liang_Kai
muqi,Muqi,牧溪|牧谿,"Muqi or Muxi (Chinese: 牧谿; Japanese: Mokkei; 1210?–1269?), also known as Fachang (Chinese: 法常), was a Chinese Chan Buddhist monk and painter who lived in the 13th century, around the end of the Southern Song dynasty (1127–1279). Today, he is considered to be one of the greatest Chan painters in history. His ink paintings, such as the Daitokuji triptych and Six Persimmons are regarded as essential Chan paintings. Muqi's style of painting has also profoundly impacted painters from later periods to follow, especially monk painters in Japan. According to Chinese secondary sources, Muqi's surname was thought to be Li. ""Muqi"" was his art name, and ""Fachang"" was, in fact, his formal name in the monastery system.",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/14/Mu-ch%27i_001.jpg/960px-Mu-ch%27i_001.jpg,China,1210,1269,Chan Painting,"Six Persimmons (Daitoku-ji, Kyoto)|Guanyin, Crane, and Gibbons|Chestnuts",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muqi

He was a descendant of the Song dynasty's imperial family through Emperor Xiaozong's brother Zhao Bogui who married a lady surnamed Song who was the granddaughter of Emperor Huizong. Zhao Bogui was a descendant of Emperor Taizu, through his son Zhao Defang. He was recommended by the Censor-in-chief Cheng Jufu to pay an audience with Kublai Khan in 1286 at the Yuan capital of Dadu, but was not awarded an important position in office. His work was however, greatly appreciated later by the Confucian-inspired Yuan Emperor Renzong. Zhao was a member of the ""Academy of Worthies"". He was married to Guan Daosheng, who was also an accomplished poet, painter and calligrapher. His rejection of the refined, gentle brushwork of his era in favour of the cruder style of the eighth century is considered to have brought about a revolution that created the modern Chinese landscape painting. He was known for his paintings of horses. His landscapes are also considered to be done in a style that focuses more on a literal laying of ground. Rather than organizing them in a foreground, middle ground, and background pattern he layers middle grounds at various heights to create a sense of depth. This pattern of organization makes his paintings appear very simple and approachable. It was this characteristic that so many people valued about his style. One of his most celebrated landscape paintings is exhibited at the Princeton University Art Museum with the title “The Mind Landscape of Xie Youyu” (幼輿丘壑), an allusion to the nature-loving scholar-official Xie Youyu (280–322). However, in 2019 Dutch scholar Lennert Gesterkamp argued that the colophon attached to the painting and mentioning Xie Youyu is a forgery, and that in fact Zhao Mengfu's intention was to honor his own spiritual master, Daoist scholar Du Daojian (1237–1318), who also celebrated nature. Zhao Mengfu had several sons with his wife Guan Daosheng. His second son, Zhao Yong, also became a famous painter and calligrapher. He was also the maternal grandfather of Wang Meng, another famous painter. Zhao Mengfu was related to the later Ming dynasty literary figure Zhao Yiguang and his son Zhao Jun.",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/86/%E8%B6%99%E9%AD%8F%E5%85%AC%E5%B0%8F%E5%83%8F.jpg,China,1254,1322,Yuan Literati Painting|Calligraphy,"Sheep and Goat (Freer Gallery)|Autumn Colors on the Qiao and Hua Mountains|Twin Pines, Level Distance",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhao_Mengfu

He was related to the House of Zhu, which was destroyed and executed by the new Qing dynasty.

He spent most of his early to mid-life in the Buddhist monkhood, returning to Nanchang when he was about fifty years old. He embarked on an artistic career soon after reentering secular life in 1680, producing works that featured his calligraphy, painting, and poetry. Most of the time, he painted simple subjects like flowers, plants, and animals and kept most of the given space empty. Toward the end of his life, he started painting more landscapes. Some of his artwork were metaphors on the fall of the Ming dynasty and its failure after being destroyed by the Qing.

He narrowly avoided catastrophe in 1644 when the Ming dynasty fell to invading Manchus and civil rebellion. Having escaped by chance from the fate to which his lineage would have assigned him, he assumed the name Yuanji Shitao no later than 1651 when he became a Buddhist monk. He moved from Wuchang, where he began his religious instruction, to Anhui in the 1660s. Throughout the 1680s he lived in Nanjing and Yangzhou, and in 1690 he moved to Beijing to find patronage for his promotion within the monastic system.
