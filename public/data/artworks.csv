Van Gogh conceived the first Bedroom in October 1888, a month after he moved into his “Yellow House” in Arles, France. This moment marked the first time the artist had a home of his own, and he had immediately and enthusiastically set about decorating, painting a suite of canvases to fill the walls. Completely exhausted from the effort, he spent two-and-a-half days in bed and was then inspired to create a painting of his bedroom. As he wrote to his brother Theo, “It amused me enormously doing this bare interior. With a simplicity à la Seurat. In ﬂat tints, but coarsely brushed in full impasto, the walls pale lilac, the ﬂoor in a broken and faded red, the chairs and the bed chrome yellow, the pillows and the sheet very pale lemon green, the bedspread blood-red, the dressing-table orange, the washbasin blue, the window green. I had wished to express utter repose with all these very different tones.” Although the picture symbolized relaxation and peace to the artist, to our eyes the canvas seems to teem with nervous energy, instability, and turmoil, an effect heightened by the sharply receding perspective.",museum_00001,Oil on canvas,73.6 × 92.3 cm (29 × 36 5/8 in.); Framed: 88.9 × 108 × 8.9 cm (35 × 42 1/2 × 3 1/2 in.),https://www.artic.edu/artworks/28560/the-bedroom,TRUE,TRUE

Van Gogh was apparently inspired by the energy of the city and by his introduction to Impressionism, and he created at least twenty-four self-portraits during his two-year stay in the French capital. This early example is modest in size and was painted on prepared artist’s board rather than canvas. Its densely dabbed brushwork, which became a hallmark of Van Gogh’s style, reﬂects the artist’s response to Georges Seurat’s revolutionary pointillist technique in A Sunday on La Grande Jatte—1884. What was for Seurat a method based on the cool objectivity of science became in Van Gogh’s hands an intense emotional language. The surface of the painting dances with particles of color—intense greens, blues, reds, and oranges. Dominating this dazzling array of staccato dots and dashes are the artist’s deep green eyes and the intensity of their gaze. “I prefer painting people’s eyes to cathedrals,” Van Gogh once wrote to Theo. “However solemn and imposing the latter may be—a human soul, be it that of a poor streetwalker, is more interesting to me.” From Paris, Van Gogh traveled to the southern town of Arles for fifteen months. At the time of his death, in 1890, he had actively pursued his art for only five years. Van Gogh’s career as a painter was actually very brief.

These works replaced the varied contemporary subjects he had painted from the 1870s through the 1890s with a single, timeless motif—water lilies. The focal point of these paintings was the artist’s beloved ﬂower garden, which featured a water garden and a smaller pond spanned by a Japanese footbridge. In his first water-lily series (1897–99), Monet painted the pond environment, with its plants, bridge, and trees neatly divided by a fixed horizon. Over time, the artist became less and less concerned with conventional pictorial space. By the time he painted Water Lilies, which comes from his third group of these works, he had dispensed with the horizon line altogether. In this spatially ambiguous canvas, the artist looked down, focusing solely on the surface of the pond, with its cluster of vegetation ﬂoating amid the reﬂection of sky and trees. Monet thus created the image of a horizontal surface on a vertical one.

Kahnweiler opened an art gallery in Paris in 1907 and in 1908 began representing Pablo Picasso, whom he introduced to Georges Braque. Kahnweiler was a great champion of the artists’ revolutionary experiment with Cubism and purchased the majority of their paintings between 1908 and 1915. He also wrote an important book, The Rise of Cubism, in 1920, which offered a theoretical framework for the movement. Kahnweiler sat as many as thirty times for this portrait. No longer seeking to create the illusion of true appearances, Picasso broke down and recombined the forms he saw. He described Kahnweiler with a network of shimmering, semitransparent surfaces that merge with the atmosphere around him. Forms are fractured into various planes and faceted shapes and presented from several points of view. Despite the portrait’s highly abstract character, however, Picasso added attributes to direct the eye and focus the mind: a wave of hair, the knot of a tie, a watch chain.

Around 1632 he moved to Amsterdam, quickly establishing himself as the town’s leading artist, specializing in history paintings and portraiture. He received many commissions and attracted a number of students who came to learn his method of painting.

Monet moved to Giverny in 1883 and immediately began to develop the property. For him, the gardens were both a passion and a second artistic medium. His Asian garden was not part of the original estate; it was located on an adjacent property with a small brook, which he purchased and enlarged into a pond for a water garden in 1893. He transformed the site into an inspired vision of cool greens and calm, reflective waters, enhanced by exotic plants such as bamboo, ginkgo, and Japanese fruit trees and a Japanese footbridge. It was not until 1899, however, that he began a series of views of the site, of which this is one. A careful craftsman who reworked his canvases multiple times, Monet was committed to painting directly from nature as much as possible and for as long as he had the correct conditions; thus, he could work on as many as eight or more canvases a day, devoting as little as an hour or less to each. In this case, he set up his easel at the edge of the water-lily pond and worked on several paintings of the subject as part of a single process. Monet’s gardens and paintings show the same fascination with the effects of time and weather on the landscape. Both are brilliant expressions of his unique visual sensitivity and emotional response to nature.

The vision took place at night, yet the painting, among hundreds of artworks van Gogh made that year, was created in several sessions during the day, under entirely different atmospheric conditions. The picturesque village nestled below the hills was based on other views—it could not be seen from his window—and the cypress at left appears much closer than it was.

He did them in Arles, in the south of France, in 1888 and 1889. Vincent painted a total of five large canvases with sunflowers in a vase, with three shades of yellow ‘and nothing else’. In this way, he demonstrated that it was possible to create an image with numerous variations of a single colour, without any loss of eloquence. The sunflower paintings had a special significance for Van Gogh: they communicated ‘gratitude’, he wrote. He hung the first two in the room of his friend, the painter Paul Gauguin, who came to live with him for a while in the Yellow House. Gauguin was impressed by the sunflowers, which he thought were ‘completely Vincent’. Van Gogh had already painted a new version during his friend’s stay and Gauguin later asked for one as a gift, which Vincent was reluctant to give him.

The walls and doors, for instance, were originally purple rather than blue. The apparently odd angle of the rear wall, meanwhile, is not a mistake on Van Gogh’s part – the corner really was skewed. The rules of perspective seem not to have been accurately applied throughout the painting, but this was a deliberate choice.

His brother Theo quickly recognized its quality and submitted it to the Salon des Indépendants in September 1889, writing Vincent of the exhibition: ""[It] strikes the eye from afar. It is a beautiful study full of air and life."" Each one of Van Gogh's irises is unique. He carefully studied their movements and shapes to create a variety of curved silhouettes bounded by wavy, twisting, and curling lines. The painting's first owner, French art critic Octave Mirbeau, one of Van Gogh's earliest supporters, wrote: ""How well he has understood the exquisite nature of flowers!""",museum_00005,Oil on canvas,Unframed: 74.3 × 94.3 cm (29 1/4 × 37 1/8 in.); Framed [Outer Dim]: 94.9 × 114.9 × 11.4 cm (37 3/8 × 45 1/4 × 4 1/2 in.),https://www.getty.edu/art/collection/object/103JNH,TRUE,TRUE

This portrait is the first of six Van Gogh painted of Roulin. A rather sensitive portrayal, he highlights Roulin’s expressive, hard-working hands and dense, bristly beard, which he rendered in abbreviated vertical brushstrokes and compared, in his letters, to that of Socrates. Believing in the expressive capacity of color, Van Gogh embraced the vibrant contrast of his friend’s blue postal uniform with its yellow trimmings. Van Gogh also painted several portraits of Madame Roulin (48.548), as well as their children, delighted, as he wrote, to depict “a whole family.”",museum_00008,Oil on canvas,81.3 x 65.4 cm (32 x 25 3/4 in.),https://collections.mfa.org/objects/32542/postman-joseph-roulin?ctx=4fada07a-0496-4356-8844-3b644770b4fc&idx=0,TRUE,TRUE

The rope in her hands leads to a cradle beyond the confines of the frame. At right, the painter inscribed the title “La Berceuse,” which means both “lullaby” and “she who rocks the cradle.” The Roulins had a baby at home, but Van Gogh conceived of the action in a broader sense as well, writing to his brother that he would like to see this painting “in the cabin of a boat” where fishermen in “their melancholy isolation, exposed to all the dangers, alone on the sad sea…would experience a feeling of being rocked, reminding them of their own lullabies.” This painting is one of five variations Van Gogh painted on the same subject.",museum_00008,Oil on canvas,92.7 x 72.7 cm (36 1/2 x 28 5/8 in.),https://collections.mfa.org/objects/33277/lullaby-madame-augustine-roulin-rocking-a-cradle-la-berceu?ctx=4fada07a-0496-4356-8844-3b644770b4fc&idx=1,TRUE,TRUE

He wrote about it to his dear friend Emile Bernard: “Such subjects certainly have a fine melancholy, but then it is fun to work in rather wild places, where one has to dig one’s easel in between the stones lest the wind should blow the whole caboodle over.” The following spring, Van Gogh sent this painting to Paris, where Paul Gauguin saw it and wrote to him: “In subjects from nature you are the only one who thinks. I talked about it with your brother, and there is one that I would like to trade with you for one of mine of your choice. The one I am talking about is a mountain landscape. Two travelers, very small, seem to be climbing there in search of the unknown…Here and there, red touches like lights, the whole in a violet tone. It is beautiful and grandiose.” Recent collaborative research has revealed beneath the surface of “Ravine” an earlier painting of a hillside in bloom, likely painted in June of the same year.

Feeling his creative drive diminishing, he voluntarily entered the Saint-Paul-de-Mausole asylum in St. Rémy in May 1889. Under Gauguin’s mentorship, the Dutch artist had learned to paint from memory, but now he fought against this tendency. In addition to the interpretations he made of works by Rembrandt, Delacroix, Millet, Doré, and others, he painted interior scenes of the clinic and the asylum garden and completed portraits of doctors. One of the fourteen paintings he realized during his twelve months of confinement is this view from the cell he used as a studio. “Through the iron-barred window I see a square field of wheat in an enclosure,” he related in a letter to his brother, Theo, “above which I see the morning sun rising in all its glory.” The muted palette is symptomatic of Van Gogh’s attempt to quell the excitement he felt under the sun’s illumination—an inspired sensation that ultimately overflowed into feelings of intense anguish. At the same time, he began equating color with vigorously painted lines to create an elemental landscape of dynamic, swirling forms.

In March 1886, Van Gogh left his native Netherlands to reunite with his brother, Theo, in the French capital. Soon after, he began meeting with several leading avant-garde artists whose works embodied strong reactions against the Impressionist tendencies that dominated the Parisian art world. In 1887, Van Gogh took up residence in Asnières, a northwestern suburb of Paris, and his encounters with Signac and Gaugin proved catalytic for the painter's developing practice. Gauguin shared Van Gogh's enthusiasm for 19th-century Japanese woodblock prints and emulated their large planes of color in his burgeoning Synthetism and Cloisonnism techniques. The compositional diagonals and strong contours in this painting recall both the distinctive divisions of the picture plane in Japanese landscapes and Gauguin’s simplified adaptation of these features. The scene's striking chromatic contrasts and thickly layered brushstrokes also point to Van Gogh's interest in the experiments with complementary colors Seurat and Signac were making in these years. The restaurant and park scenes and the views of the Seine that Van Gogh completed while living in Asnières began to demonstrate the indelible influence of Synthetism, Divisionism, and Pointillism even as a unique Post-Impressionist style was emerging in his paintings.",museum_00012,Oil on canvas,Unframed: 7 1/2 × 10 5/8 in.

He had moved there in February 1888, hopeful that its bright skies and bountiful flora would allow him to fully explore the effects of color and set his work apart from other Post-Impressionist painters. He began filling his canvases with views of the region: expansive fields and skies, blossoming fruit trees, interiors and exteriors of houses, depictions of townsfolk and self-portraits, and floral still lifes—works that constituted the iconography of Van Gogh's first great period. By this time, the techniques of Japanese printmaking were deeply ingrained into his creative process, and he conceived the majority of his compositions with what he called his ""Japanese eye."" Stylistic features he borrowed from 19th-century ukiyo-e woodcuts for this still life include the high line of horizon that allows a detailed view of the flowers, the emphasis on the foreground and background to suggest spatial depth, and bright, flat areas of color. Although the monochromatic green tones are immediately perceived, Van Gogh introduced contrasting notes throughout the composition, painting streaks of blue around the orange terracotta pot and adding a red signature. His method of squeezing tube paint directly onto his canvas to create bold outlines testifies to the intense and prolific pace of his creative output during his first summer in Arles.",museum_00012,Oil on canvas,Unframed: 13 × 16 1/2 in.
