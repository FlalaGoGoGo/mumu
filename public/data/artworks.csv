Upon completion of his training Rembrandt returned to Leiden. Around 1632 he moved to Amsterdam, quickly establishing himself as the town’s leading artist, specializing in history paintings and portraiture. He received many commissions and attracted a number of students who came to learn his method of painting. Although this painting was once highly regarded as a famous self-portrait, technical and stylistic evidence indicates that it was created by an unknown artist in Rembrandt’s workshop. The paint mixtures, types of pigments used, and presence of a double ground—a red lower ground covered by a dark gray upper layer—are all consistent with the materials and practices used in his workshop. This painting is unusual in that the costume is executed in a manner quite different from the face; whereas the features are modeled with delicate nuance, the costume is hinted at with a variety of bold techniques. Rembrandt’s portraits generally do not show such markedly different techniques in the face and the costume. This and other stylistic considerations are sufficient to remove the painting from Rembrandt's own oeuvre. It may well be that Rembrandt, after having posed for this painting, approved its concept and manner of execution before allowing its sale. To judge from the number of self-portraits Rembrandt painted and etched, and from the numerous portraits of him made by members of his workshop, there was a ready market for images of the artist.",national-gallery-of-art-washington-us,Oil on canvas,overall: 92 x 75.5 cm (36 1/4 x 29 3/4 in.); framed: 125.1 x 107 x 11.4 cm (49 1/4 x 42 1/8 x 4 1/2 in.),https://www.nga.gov/artworks/1209-portrait-rembrandt,FALSE,FALSE

In early 1893, he acquired a swampy area across the railroad tracks abutting his property and petitioned the village council for permission to divert a small stream into it. But it was only toward the end of that decade that he turned to the garden he had created there as a rich source of artistic inspiration. In 1899, Monet painted 12 works from a single vantage point, focusing on the arching blue–green bridge and the microcosm of his water garden. Among the 12 works was the National Gallery's Japanese Footbridge. Monet designed and built the landscape that appears in the painting—from the bridge to the pond and its shape, to the water lilies and other plantings. The artist, who as a leader of the impressionists had espoused the spontaneity of directly observed works that capture the fleeting effects of light and color, had in these later paintings subjected a nature he re–created to sustained, meditated scrutiny. When Monet exhibited these paintings at Durand–Ruel's gallery in 1890, a number of critics mentioned his debt to Japanese art. More telling, the impenetrable green enclosure—heightened in the National Gallery painting by the placement of the top of the bridge's arch just below the painting's top edge—harkens back to the hortus conclusus (closed garden) of medieval images, while also evoking a dreamlike contemplative zone consonant with symbolist literature, especially poems such as ""Le Nénuphar blanc"" by Stéphane Mallarmé. Gustave Geffroy described this effect in his review of the exhibition (Le Journal, November 26, 1900), speaking of ""this minuscule pool where some mysterious corollas blossom,"" and ""a calm pool, immobile, rigid, and deep like a mirror, upon which white water lilies blossom forth, a pool surrounded by soft and hanging greenery which reflects itself in it.""",national-gallery-of-art-washington-us,Oil on canvas,overall: 81.3 x 101.6 cm (32 x 40 in.); framed: 101 x 120.7 x 7.6 cm (39 3/4 x 47 1/2 x 3 in.),https://www.nga.gov/artworks/74796-japanese-footbridge,TRUE,TRUE

From afar, the architecture of Rouen Cathedral seems sturdy and imposing. The thick texture of Monet’s paint heightens the effect. But as you move closer, the cathedral seems to dissolve into fragments of color. The illusion of its solidity comes apart. Monet painted a series of more than 30 views of Rouen Cathedral in Normandy between 1892 and 1893. He moved from one canvas to another to capture the distinctive effects of light and atmosphere throughout the day.

Monet began to explore painting in a series, or creating groups of works of almost identical subjects. The series paintings were a break from impressionism in two critical respects: the works, based on campaigns in front of the motif, were usually extensively reworked in the studio and lacked the spontaneity integral to impressionism; and, the motif itself was secondary to effects of light and weather. The new qualities of Monet's series paintings were given concentrated expression in the Rouen Cathedral paintings, in which the stone facade fills the canvases. Monet showed 20 of the 30 extant Cathedral works, among them this one, as a group in an 1895 exhibition. Individual paintings, named according to the view and weather conditions depicted, are chiefly distinguished by color, which assumes the principal role in the series. The cumulative impression reported by visitors extended beyond the impact of individual works. The rich surfaces of the paintings seem to imitate the textural fabric of the cathedral's carved stone. Individually the paintings depict a religious edifice, but collectively the series becomes a denial of the solidity of Rouen Cathedral as an entity, and gives precedence to artistic concerns of light, color, and mood. In late January or early February 1892, Monet rented rooms across from Rouen cathedral. He remained until spring, painting its looming façade many times, most often as we see it here, close up and cropped to the sides. The next winter he returned to paint the cathedral again, making in all more than 30 views of it. But it was less the carved Gothic façade that was Monet's subject than the atmosphere—the enveloppe—that surrounded the building. ""To me the motif itself is an insignificant factor,"" Monet said. ""What I want to reproduce is what exists between the motif and me.""",national-gallery-of-art-washington-us,Oil on canvas,overall: 100.1 x 65.9 cm (39 3/8 x 25 15/16 in.); framed: 121.6 x 88.3 cm (47 7/8 x 34 3/4 in.),https://www.nga.gov/artworks/46524-rouen-cathedral-west-façade,TRUE,TRUE

Their meaning was evident to everyone. From Père Paillard (Father Lechery or Debauchery) inscribed on its base, they recognized the local Catholic bishop, Monseigneur Martin, who entreated Gauguin to stop his liaisons with local women, while pursuing them himself (with Thérèse and others) despite his vows of celibacy. Gauguin shows the bishop for what he considered him to be: a nude, horned devil. Though outwardly pious, Père Paillard's solemn expression and praying hands fail to mask his inner desires. Two nude women, carved in shallow relief near the base of the sculpture, may allude to his private predilection. Its specific context notwithstanding, the sculpture also forcefully embodies the artist's primitive aesthetic and anti-Western values. Gauguin retained the cylindrical form of the miro wood log (native to the Marquesas Islands where he moved in his final years) in the finished figure, a reflection of his concept of beauty as a harmony between subject and material.

The Tahiti of his depictions was derived from native folklore supplemented by material culled from books written by earlier European visitors and overlaid with allusions to western culture. The pose of the standing nude, for instance, is derived from a medieval statue of the biblical Eve and more distantly from the Venus Pudica of classical sculpture. The artist placed this rich combination of references to original sin, the loss of virginity, and occidental standards of beauty and art within the context of his Tahitian mythology and primitive, non–European aesthetics. The meaning of the title Parau na te Varua ino is unclear. The phrase varua ino, evil spirit or devil, refers to the masked kneeling figure and parau means words, suggesting the interpretation ""Words of the Devil."" The meaning of many of Gauguin's Tahitian paintings remains elusive.

Midday sun suffuses the panorama, its intensity heightening the artist's palette and suppressing incidental detail to clarify the crowded scene. Edmond Renoir, the artist's younger brother and a novice journalist in 1872, later recounted the inception of this painting in an interview. He told how Renoir secured an owner's permission to occupy an upper floor of a café for one day to depict the view of the famous bridge. Edmond periodically delayed passersby long enough for the artist to record their appearance. Renoir even noted Edmond's presence, walking stick in hand and straw boater on his head, in two locations. If, as Edmond indicated, Pont Neuf, Paris was painted during a single day, it was preceded by careful preparations, possibly including preliminary delineation of the permanent architectural features. The painting seems more richly nuanced and the subject laden with broader meaning than Edmond's anecdote would suggest.

In contrast to works by most of the other artists in the group—soon to be dubbed the impressionists—Renoir's paintings were relatively well received. The Dancer in particular was singled out for attention. While some dismissed it as being little more than a sketch and lacking in good draftsmanship (the same criticisms leveled at many of the works on display), others found it graceful and charming, praising its realism and originality of conception. As one writer remarked, ""The Danseuse is true to life and has a fine and nervous elegance in its truth."" Another admired the dancer's head, which he described as ""fresh, alive, with a very simple modeling and a very accurate bearing."" The Dancer inevitably calls to mind the work of Renoir's fellow impressionist Edgar Degas, whose name is now synonymous with depictions of ballet dancers. In contrast to Degas, whose interest lay in depicting dancers in repose, captured in unguarded and unselfconscious moments, Renoir chose to paint a more formal portrait. Both the painting's scale and the figure's prominence (placed in the very center of the composition, she dominates the entire canvas) hark back to traditional portraits, lending this work a gravity somewhat at odds with the painting's modern subject. Shown in profile, her silk-slippered feet placed in classic fifth position, Renoir's dancer is poised and alert as she turns her gaze toward the viewer. Renoir accentuated the dancer's youth, highlighting the roundness of her face, the still boyish flatness of her chest, even the way the fingers of her left hand appear to toy nervously with tulle of her skirt. Although Renoir himself never identified the figure, the model is almost certainly Henriette Henriot, the young actress who posed regularly for the artist in the mid-1870s and whose likeness was featured in La Parisienne (National Museum of Wales, Cardiff), another large-scale painting shown by Renoir in the 1874 exhibition. Renoir skillfully transformed his model's appearance, depicting her with equal verve as both a sweet-faced adolescent on the verge of adulthood and a fashionable performer. Ultimately, however, Renoir's virtuoso brushwork is the painting's most compelling feature. His paint handling is varied, ranging from the delicate brushstrokes that define the dancer's face to the loose, almost careless application of paint in the picture's background. The dancer's skirt is a true tour de force; Renoir masterfully captured the gauzy softness of the tulle. It floats about her body like a cloud, seeming to dissolve into the hazy background, the fabric as light and insubstantial as mist. Four years after appearing in this historic exhibition, The Dancer was purchased by Charles-Henri Deudon, who amassed a small but important collection of impressionist paintings. In addition to this work, Deudon would go on to acquire five more paintings by Renoir as well as Manet's Plum Brandy.",national-gallery-of-art-washington-us,Oil on canvas,overall: 142.5 x 94.5 cm (56 1/8 x 37 3/16 in.); framed: 164.1 x 116.2 cm (64 5/8 x 45 3/4 in.),https://www.nga.gov/artworks/1211-dancer,TRUE,FALSE

Brilliant prismatic hues envelop the child in an atmosphere of warm light and charmingly convey her innocent appeal. Specific identifications have been proposed for the girl, but none is convincing. More likely, Renoir depicted a neighborhood child whose pretty features pleased him.

In 2002 the Gallery acquired its first and, so far, only significant sculpture by Picasso, Head of a Woman (Fernande), 1909. That work is now joined by Figure Décorative, 1908, the first sculpture by Matisse to enter the collection. These two works, both bronzes that treat the female form and were made at roughly the same time, could not be more different. While Picasso was attempting to translate his analytic cubism into three dimensions in Head of a Woman, resulting in a work of multiple intersecting facets, Matisse was concerned with something much more traditional in Figure Décorative, namely the modern revival of Venus as a subject for art. The model was his wife, and indeed her portrait may be discerned in the head, but the apparently autoerotic placement of her left hand between her legs identifies the work strongly with traditional representations of Venus. And yet there is nothing traditional about the way this figure confronts our gaze, not coyly or demurely but boldly. Matisse had recently seen Picasso’s revolutionary painting Les Demoiselles d’Avignon in the artist’s studio, with its five nude female figures staring down the spectator. Already in rivalry with Picasso, Matisse attempted a similar rawness of pose and expression in a painting of 1907, La coiffure, whose pose he then adapted for the Gallery’s new sculpture. Every limb in Figure Décorative seems to have its own energy, indeed buoyancy, which gives a sense of bursting inner life to the figure as a whole. This, taken together with the figure’s buried hand, crossed legs, and pursed lips, seems to suggest that she is harboring a vital secret.",national-gallery-of-art-washington-us,Bronze,height: 73.03 cm (28 3/4 in.); gross weight: 41.731 kg (92 lb.),https://www.nga.gov/artworks/154548-figure-decorative,TRUE,FALSE

He moved to Florence toward the end of 1504. Saint George and the Dragon, one of two versions of the theme by the artist, belonged to a series of miniature panels that Raphael painted in Florence for the celebrated court of Urbino. A Roman soldier of Christian faith, Saint George saved the daughter of a pagan king by subduing a dragon with his lance; the princess then led the dragon to the city, where the saint killed it with his sword, prompting the king and his subjects to convert to Christianity. One unusual feature of the painting is the saint's blue garter on his armor–covered leg. Its inscription, HONI, begins the phrase Honi soit qui mal y pense (Disgraced be he who thinks ill of it), the motto of the chivalric Order of the Garter, of which George is the patron saint. Duke Guidobaldo da Montefeltro of Urbino was made a knight of the prestigious order in 1504 by King Henry VII of England.

The girl has turned in her chair and interacts with the viewer through her direct gaze. Girl with the Red Hat is portrayed with unusual spontaneity and informality. The artist’s exquisite use of color is this painting’s most striking characteristic, for both its compositional and its psychological effects. Vermeer concentrated the two major colors in two distinct areas: a vibrant red for the hat and a sumptuous blue for the robe. He then used the intensity of the white cravat to unify the whole. Following in his father’s footsteps, Vermeer also was an art dealer in Delft. There is no documentation of his artistic training or apprenticeship, but in 1653 he became a master in the Saint Luke’s Guild in Delft; he would serve as head of that guild four times in the 1660s and 1670s. Although he was well regarded in his lifetime, he was heavily in debt when he died in 1675.

A woman dressed in a blue jacket with fur trim stands serenely at a table in a corner of a room. The scales in her right hand are at equilibrium, suggestive of her inner state of mind. A large painting of the Last Judgment, framed in black, hangs on the back wall of the room. A shimmering blue cloth, open boxes, two strands of pearls, and a gold chain lie on the sturdy table. Soft light comes in through the window and illuminates the scene. The woman is so pensive that the viewer almost hesitates to intrude on her quiet moment of contemplation. The visual juxtaposition of the woman and the Last Judgment is reinforced by thematic parallels: to judge is to weigh. This scene has religious implications that seem related to Saint Ignatius of Loyola’s instructions, in his Spiritual Exercises, that the faithful, prior to meditating, first examine their conscience and weigh their sins as if facing Judgment Day. Only such introspection could lead to virtuous choices along the path of life. Woman Holding a Balance thus allegorically urges us to conduct our lives with temperance and moderation. The woman is poised between the earthly treasures of gold and pearls and a visual reminder of the eternal consequences of her actions. Vermeer emphasized this message through his superbly refined composition and lighting. The hand holding the balance, for example, occupies a position directly in front of the frame’s dark corner, while the scales are set off against the bare plaster wall—an effect that Vermeer created through subtle spatial manipulation. Note, for instance, that the bottom of the Last Judgment’s frame is slightly higher to the left of the woman than it is behind her back, creating room for the balance.",national-gallery-of-art-washington-us,Oil on canvas,painted surface: 39.7 x 35.5 cm (15 5/8 x 14 in.); stretcher size: 42.5 x 38 cm (16 3/4 x 14 15/16 in.); framed: 62.9 x 58.4 x 7.6 cm (24 3/4 x 23 x 3 in.),https://www.nga.gov/artworks/1236-woman-holding-balance,TRUE,FALSE

In this exquisite painting, diffused light softly illuminates the tabletop, the woman’s face, and her rich lemon-yellow morning jacket. Accents on the pearls decorating her jewelry box, her earrings, and her satin hair ribbons further enliven the image. The woman’s open gaze engages the viewer, which suggests that the painting may be a portrait instead of a generalized portrayal of a young woman at her writing table. Johannes Vermeer became a master in the Saint Luke’s Guild of Delft on December 29, 1653. At that time he specialized in history painting, and his first works were large-scale mythological and religious paintings. Shortly thereafter he began to paint the genre scenes, landscapes, and allegories for which he has become so renowned.

The laurel and palm also happened to be the personal emblem of Bernardo Bembo, Venetian ambassador to Florence, whose deep and abiding relationship with Ginevra is revealed in poems dedicated to them. Their platonic friendship was typical of the era and consistent with Ginevra's elite status as the daughter of a wealthy banker.

Berthe Morisot is the woman to whom he alluded. Morisot, an original member of the group, showed in seven of its eight exhibitions and contributed financially to sustain the impressionist movement. The Mother and Sister of the Artist, one of Morisot's largest works, was exhibited at the Salon of 1870 and perhaps again in 1874 at the first Impressionist exhibition. The painting, a family portrait and an intimate domestic genre scene, was begun when Morisot's sister Edma Pontillon stayed with her family in the winter of 1869–1870 to await the birth of her first child, a pregnancy discreetly disguised by Edma's loose white morning robe. Anxious about sending the painting to the Salon, Morisot solicited Manet's advice, and on the last day for submissions he visited the Morisot home. Morisot's correspondence reveals that, rather than offer verbal suggestions, Manet extensively repainted the figure of the artist's mother.

The horizontal and vertical elements of his compositions, assiduously calibrated to produce a balanced asymmetry, represented forces of opposition that parallel the dynamic equilibrium at work in the natural world. By 1921 Mondrian had distilled his compositions into black lines that intersect at right angles, defining rectangles painted only in white or gray and the three primary colors. In 1918 the artist turned one of these square canvases 45 degrees to rest ""on point,"" doing so without rotating the linear elements within the composition. Approximately three years later he merged that format with the elemental color scheme of his mature works to produce this monumental painting, the earliest of the neo-plastic diamond or lozenge compositions. Repainted around 1925, when the black lines were thickened, this picture relates to several other works of the 1920s, where color is restricted to the periphery.

In this study of light and reflection, structures on the bank and on the river are simplified into geometric shapes that contrast with the organic lushness surrounding them. The composition threatens to dissolve into patches of color, and pictorial space is flattened. Only near the end of his life did Cézanne’s critical reception, once so derisive, become more open to this aesthetic, which also had an enormous impact on successive generations of painters. The painting also suggests Cézanne’s working method. The concentration of color in the central motif of the blue house, in the boat with a blue cabin, and in the green houseboat next to it indicate that the artist started in the middle of the composition and moved outward. Landscape and architectural elements are formed more solidly than their reflections in the river, which are composed of paint thinly applied with fluid brushstrokes, almost as though in watercolor.

Sensitively portrayed in Mardi Gras, his face in Harlequin was replaced by an impassive mask, a further, more abstract stage in Cézanne's development of the theme. Harlequin's traditional diamond patterned costume, bicorn hat, and the wooden sword that denoted his buffoonery have appealed to artists from the eighteenth century to the twentieth, and the character appears in Watteau's Italian Comedians and Picasso's Family of Saltimbanques. The opulent red and blue color scheme and lush surface texture are appropriate to Harlequin's theatrical origin, yet Cézanne emphasized the remoteness of the solitary figure. Pissarro brought Cézanne into the impressionist movement and Cézanne showed in the first and third exhibitions, but in the late 1870s he stopped exhibiting in Paris and withdrew to Aix.

The poet and art historian Antony Valabrègue, who grew up with Cézanne in Aix, sat for the young artist several times in the 1860s. Cézanne chose a fairly conventional format for this portrait—a three-quarter-length figure with face turned slightly to the side, and plain backdrop—but he executed it in a wholly radical manner. He eschewed the precise delineation of form, evidenced especially along the edges of the coat, where black pigment spills onto the gray of the background. Even more strikingly, he used a palette knife—a blunt instrument normally used to mix paint—to apply thick layers of pigment, achieving a ferocious, even crude effect seen, most obviously, in Valabrègue’s face. Even where the artist used a brush to form the tightly clenched fists, for instance, the handling is raw and turbulent. As Cézanne eagerly anticipated, the work was rejected by the Salon of 1866.

This sunlit scene shows the extent to which the artist absorbed the lessons of impressionism, of capturing the visual sensations of nature with modulated brushwork that examines the relationship between color and light. The thin application of paint, with spots of canvas showing through, contributes to the light-soaked appearance of the scene. A bright palette of predominantly yellows and greens unifies the composition, while Cézanne’s distinct brushwork—with horizontal strokes creating the mirrored surface of the river and short parallel strokes forming much of the foliage—results in a cohesive, rhythmic surface.

His colors deepen, and his brushwork assumes greater expression. Spaces become more enclosed. Compare this landscape with Houses in Provence: The Riaux Valley near L'Estaque, c. 1883, executed 20 years earlier. That painting is open, while a web of branches screens this one. This place is crabbed and remote—much more difficult and forbidding. Compare the skies, too. This blue is no longer airy, but leaden, darkened with touches of purple and green. Even the pale buildings have been replaced by a deeper ocher. Late in his life Cézanne was attracted not only to the fundamental order of nature, but also its chaos and restlessness.

Hendrik van Uylenburgh, Saskia’s cousin, was a painter and flourishing art dealer in Amsterdam. After moving to Amsterdam Rembrandt invested in Van Uylenburgh’s business and came to live in the art dealer’s house. The promising young painter must have met Saskia soon thereafter.

And they came with haste, and found Mary and Joseph, and the babe lying in a manger.... And when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising of the child, his name was called Jesus."" This cursory reference to this significant event in the early childhood of Christ allowed artists throughout history wide latitude in the way they represented the circumcision. The predominant Dutch pictorial tradition was to depict the ceremony as occurring in the Temple, but in this beautifully evocative painting Rembrandt places the scene in front of the stable. In this innovative composition, Mary, rather than Joseph or another male figure, tenderly holds her son in her lap in front of the ladder of the stable, just as she will cradle his corpse some thirty-three years later near a ladder leaning against the cross. In this way Rembrandt suggests the fundamental association between the circumcision and Christ's final shedding of blood at his Crucifixion. Onlookers crowd around the scribe who records the name of the Child in a large book. Iconographic, compositional, and documentary evidence all point strongly to Rembrandt's authorship.

The beaver hat, dark fur cloak, and massive gold chain and medallion have suggested to many that the sitter was Slavic, but the painting's title has no factual basis. Such exotic paintings allowed Rembrandt to expand the limits of portraiture because he was not constrained by traditional conventions. Through dramatic accents of light and dark on the sitter's face, bold brushwork, and dense application of paint, Rembrandt created a powerful, almost sculptural presence. By emphasizing the man’s furrowed brow and by shading his eyes, Rembrandt has portrayed him as a thoughtful individual.

Rembrandt here depicts the moment when Jupiter and Mercury quietly reveal themselves to the elderly couple Philemon and Baucis, as described in the eighth book of Ovid’s commentaries. Rembrandt, who was able to penetrate the essence of the myth as no artist ever had, silhouetted Mercury against the primary light source to enhance the inherent drama of the moment. The moral of the story is that hospitality and openness to strangers are virtues that are always rewarded. As depicted by Rembrandt, the hosts Philemon and Baucis, who come to recognize that they are in the presence of gods when the food and wine keep replenishing themselves, try to catch their only goose so they can offer their divine guests better fare. Jupiter commands them not to kill the goose and blesses their sparse offering with a firm yet comforting gesture. Dressed in exotic and loosely draped robes, Jupiter dominates the scene and takes on a Christ-like appearance that strongly echoes the Christ from Leonardo da Vinci’s Last Supper, which Rembrandt knew from a print.

The belief that it was right to follow nature, and that the pursuit of pleasure was natural, influenced the prevailing conception of the nude. François Boucher, who became the first painter to Louis XV, fully explored his century's interest in the relationship between the rational and the sensual. In The Bath of Venus, the mythological goddess has lost any allusions to classical history painting and is offered up to the viewer as an object of physical beauty. Venus, located in a lush garden setting, coyly attempts to restrain a pouting Cupid as two putti point to the scene in mocking disapproval. Boucher's success in communicating the charm and sensuality of the nude lies in his mastery of color and fluid brushstrokes. Venus is rendered in porcelain tones, delicately accented in pink, her body highlighted against luscious blue velvet and silk. The two white doves at her feet contrast a thick impasto surface with the transparent water and cool greens and blues of the foliage. The painting exemplifies the rococo love of asymmetric lines and sinuous curves, artfully arranged to seduce both the eye and the mind of the beholder.",national-gallery-of-art-washington-us,Oil on canvas,overall: 107 x 84.8 cm (42 1/8 x 33 3/8 in.); framed: 132.1 x 110.2 x 7.6 cm (52 x 43 3/8 x 3 in.),https://www.nga.gov/artworks/12200-bath-venus,TRUE,FALSE

Turner established the quiet mood of the late-afternoon scene with two ivy-covered elm trees, whose soft, feathery leaves and curving limbs frame the painting. Long shadows create elegant patterns on the lawn that almost obscure the human element in the scene. Scattered about are a gardener's ladder, a hoop, a doll on a red chair, and an open portfolio of pictures that have been just left behind by figures watching the Lord Mayor's ceremonial barge. The painting was done about eight years after Turner's first stay in Venice, where his perception of nature and the physical world was profoundly changed by the city's unique light and atmosphere. Light immobilizes the river and gives its surface a dreamlike shimmer. The stable mass of the classical gazebo, the delicate linear clarity of its architectural details, and the carefully depicted windows in the buildings on the left bank of the river coexist in Turner's vision with the heavy impasto of the sun's forceful rays that spill over the top of the embankment wall and dissolve the stone's very substance.",national-gallery-of-art-washington-us,Oil on canvas,overall: 92.1 x 122.2 cm (36 1/4 x 48 1/8 in.); framed: 111.1 x 143.2 x 9.5 cm (43 3/4 x 56 3/8 x 3 3/4 in.),https://www.nga.gov/artworks/116-mortlake-terrace,TRUE,FALSE

For an artist committed to the depiction of modern life, the theater in all of its forms--the ballet, the opera, even the more raucous café-concerts--held a special appeal. What intrigued him the most, however, was not the formal, polished performance, but rather the behind-the-scenes, casual, candid moments of dancers rehearsing or resting. It is a theme that the artist was to explore time and again, not only in his ballet paintings but also in his horse-racing scenes. Painted c. 1879, The Dance Lesson is the first ballet scene in a distinctive group of some forty pictures, all executed in an unusual horizontal format. Degas had already begun to experiment with this format in some of his racing scenes in order to create an almost panoramic sense of space. In the ballet scenes, the setting was transformed into an oblong rehearsal room populated by dancers in various states of activity and exhaustion. This format, which has been likened to a frieze, has a decidedly decorative quality. Degas' fascination with the unexpected views and flattened forms of Japanese prints is also apparent: figures are sharply cropped and placed off center, while the floor, which dominates the scene, seems tipped upward, an illusion that is accentuated by the elongated format. Like most of his ballet scenes, The Dance Lesson is a deceptively straightforward image. Although the overall effect seems spontaneous, the picture was carefully orchestrated from start to finish. Degas produced a compositional sketch in one of his notebooks (possibly after he had already started the painting), laying out several crucial components: the seated figure at the center, the window at the far right, and the double bass and open violin case at the far left. Into this basic framework he then introduced the figures of other dancers. Pulled from a number of his drawings and other paintings, these figures, like mannequins, were moved and arranged in artful configurations. The dancer adjusting her bow, for example, appears not only in a number of pastels but also in several paintings from this group of friezelike compositions (The Detroit Institute of Arts, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York). Even after the forms had been placed within the composition, they were subject to change. Degas altered a number of details, many still visible to the naked eye: the angle of the seated dancer's foot; the positioning of the legs and back of the chair; and the violin case, which the artist painted out at an early stage. When shown in the fifth impressionist exhibition in 1880, The Dance Lesson passed largely unnoticed, and what commentary it elicited was equivocal. The critic Joris Karl Huysmans admired other works Degas exhibited and praised the artist's keen observational skills. Nevertheless, he characterized this painting as ""dismal,"" though more in response to the mood than to the execution. Paul Mantz, troubled by the artist's tendency to slip into caricature, was less enthusiastic, though he did praise its ""transparently fine atmosphere.""",national-gallery-of-art-washington-us,Oil on canvas,overall: 38 x 88 cm (14 15/16 x 34 5/8 in.); framed: 59.7 x 108.3 x 5.1 cm (23 1/2 x 42 5/8 x 2 in.),https://www.nga.gov/artworks/93045-dance-lesson,TRUE,TRUE

The Little Dancer Aged Fourteen, the title given by the artist, has become one of the most beloved works of art, well known through the many bronze casts produced from this unique original statuette, following the artist's death. The sculpture was not so warmly received when she first appeared. The critics protested almost unanimously that she was ugly, but had to acknowledge the work's astonishing realism as well as its revolutionary nature. The mixed media of the Little Dancer, basically a wax statuette dressed in real clothes, was very innovative, most of all because she was considered a modern subject—a student dancer of the Paris Opera Ballet. Marie van Goethem, the model for the figure, was the daughter of a Belgian tailor and a laundress; her working–class background was typical of the Paris Opera school's ballerinas. These dancers were known as ""petits rats de l'opéra,"" literally opera rats, presumably because of their scurrying around the opera stage in tiny, fast–moving steps. But the derogatory association of the name with dirt and poverty was also intentional. Young, pretty, and poor, the ballet students also were potential targets of male ""protectors."" Degas understood the predicament of the Little Dancer—what the contemporary reviewer Joris–Karl Huysmans called her ""terrible reality."" The Little Dancer is a very poignant, deeply felt work of art in which a little girl of fourteen, in spite of the difficult position in which she is placed, both physically and psychologically, struggles for a measure of dignity: her head is held high, though her arms and hands are uncomfortably stretched behind her back. In the context of the evolution of sculpture, the Little Dancer is a groundbreaking work of art. The liberating idea that any medium or technique necessary to convey the desired effect is fair game may be traced back to this sculpture. Degas represented a working–class subject, though not an everyday one, with both realism and compassion, but without moralizing. In so doing, he captured with brilliant simplicity the difficult tension between art and life.",national-gallery-of-art-washington-us,"Pigmented beeswax, clay, metal armature, rope, paintbrushes, human hair, silk and linen ribbon, cotton faille bodice, cotton and silk tutu, linen slippers, on wooden base",overall without base: 98.9 x 34.7 x 35.2 cm (38 15/16 x 13 11/16 x 13 7/8 in); weight: 49 lb.

Many critics reacted with shock to its subject, which they found harshly realistic and even ugly, and to its unconventional incorporation of actual, rather than sculpturally imitated, fabric and hair. In his other sculptures, not meant for exhibition, Degas worked less in pursuit of perfect forms than in restless exploration of movement and composition. Using soft, pliable materials, he built up his figures on makeshift armatures reinforced with brush handles, matches, or whatever else was at hand. The waxes, whose lumpish surfaces leave his labor visible, have a translucent character that conveys an astonishing sense of life. Like the Little Dancer, The Tub employs actual as well as represented materials. The figure may be wax, the water plaster, but they occupy a real lead basin resting on a wooden base covered with plaster-soaked rags. In a bird's-eye view, the circular tub and square base create a foil for the convoluted twists of the figure.

Against the broad beach at low tide, the town's quay and lighthouse, and cloud-filled blue skies, a group of women and children set out to gather fish and shellfish from shallow pools for their evening dinner. The figures, arranged along the light-dappled shore like figures on a classical frieze, are followed by several more people descending the slipway. John Singer Sargent's impressive composition and deft brushwork endow the popular, but often overly sentimentalized, 19th-century subject of everyday peasant life with an unprecedented freshness. While this painting gives an impression of spontaneity and facile execution, Sargent devoted an extraordinary amount of effort to preparing it for the 1878 Paris Salon, a highly regulated annual exhibition. The young artist understood the conservative nature of the Salon and therefore executed the canvas as formally and tightly as possible given his training. Even before the Salon closed, the painting had found a patron, marking the second sale of Sargent's career. Born to American parents in Florence, Italy, Sargent studied in Paris in the 1870s at the prestigious École des Beaux-Arts and with the fashionable French painter Carolus-Duran. During these formative years before his rapid rise to fame as a portraitist, Sargent loved to sketch the sea and coastal life while traveling with his family. The artist began to develop En route pour la pêche, along with a related work in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, at age 21. These were his first genre paintings (scenes of everyday life) and, along with their many preparatory works, constituted his first large body of work devoted to one locale.",national-gallery-of-art-washington-us,Oil on canvas,overall: 78.7 × 122.9 cm (31 × 48 3/8 in.); framed: 117.16 × 161.77 × 13.97 cm (46 1/8 × 63 11/16 × 5 1/2 in.),https://www.nga.gov/artworks/166472-en-route-pour-la-peche-setting-out-fish,FALSE,FALSE

Although she appears rather serious in this formal portrait, Mrs. White—called ""Daisy""—was known to be quite lively in her social pursuits. As the author Henry James wrote from London in 1888: ""The happy American here, beyond all others, is Mrs. Henry White."" When Gilded Age aristocrats and socialites wanted someone who could capture both their gifts and their status, they called on John Singer Sargent. Paris was the artist's home from 1874, when he began study there with the well-known portraitist Carolus-Duran, until 1886, when he moved to London. He frequently exhibited portraits at the annual Paris Salon, which led to many new assignments. Such was the case with this likeness of the wealthy Daisy White. Upon seeing Sargent's Lady with the Rose (1882, The Metropolitan Museum of Art) at the Salon of 1882, White arranged her commission. The subject came from a prominent academic and social New York lineage and in 1879 had married diplomat Henry White, scion of a distinguished Maryland family. When White requested her portrait at age 29, her husband was the First Secretary of the American legation in Paris. The couple lived mostly in that city before Henry White was posted to Vienna in 1883 (and later to London). Sargent began the portrait in late 1882, and worked on it alongside the painting of another American woman living in Paris, Virginie Amélie Gautreau (Madame X, 1884, The Metropolitan Museum of Art). However, White left Paris for obligations in the south of France after only a few sittings. Gathering up the enormous and unusually wide canvas, the artist followed her and kept ""brushing away"" on the portrait in Nice and back in his Paris studio. The virtuoso handling of the dress—featuring a dazzling array of white fabrics of varying texture, including satin, lace, and tulle—and of the highlights on the fan and opera glasses makes the subject glow against the elegant chaise and muted background.",national-gallery-of-art-washington-us,Oil on canvas,overall: 225.1 × 143.8 cm (88 5/8 × 56 5/8 in.); framed: 249.24 × 167.96 × 12.07 cm (98 1/8 × 66 1/8 × 4 3/4 in.),https://www.nga.gov/artworks/166470-margaret-stuyvesant-rutherfurd-white-mrs-henry-white,FALSE,FALSE

There, in the last year before his death, he created almost 130 paintings. Within the first week, he began Irises, working from nature in the asylum's garden. The cropped composition, divided into broad areas of vivid color with monumental irises overflowing its borders, was probably influenced by the decorative patterning of Japanese woodblock prints. There are no known drawings for this painting; Van Gogh himself considered it a study. His brother Theo quickly recognized its quality and submitted it to the Salon des Indépendants in September 1889, writing Vincent of the exhibition: ""[It] strikes the eye from afar. It is a beautiful study full of air and life."" Each one of Van Gogh's irises is unique. He carefully studied their movements and shapes to create a variety of curved silhouettes bounded by wavy, twisting, and curling lines.

By the following summer he had painted them at least thirty times, at different times throughout the seasons. Wheatstacks was Monet's first series and the first in which he concentrated on a single subject, differentiating pictures only by color, touch, composition, and lighting and weather conditions. He said, ""For me a landscape hardly exists at all as a landscape, because its appearance is constantly changing; but it lives by virtue of its surroundings, the air and the light which vary continually."" After beginning outdoors, Monet reworked each painting in his studio to create the color harmonies that unify each canvas. The pinks in the sky echo the snow's reflections, and the blues of the wheatstacks' shadows are found in the wintry light shining on the stacks, in the houses' roofs, and in the snowy earth. With raised, broken brushstrokes, Monet captured nuances of light and created a solid, geometric structure that prevents the surface from simply melting into blobs.

Painted during the spring of 1873 as the country struggled to rebuild following the Franco-Prussian war, this Sunrise might also metaphorically suggest a new day dawning in France.

His exercises in different painting techniques are seen in the way he softened the outlines of forms and the manner in which he explored the descriptive possibilities of brushstrokes: broad and flat in the tablecloth, sketchy in the apples, and short and dense in the flower petals. Monet's technique is also apparent in the use of light to animate the surfaces of the flowers, fruit, and tablecloth, and in the way the colors are affected by the light, by reflections, and by each other.

Extending the building's encrusted stone surface to the richly varied impasto surface of his painting, he portrayed the cathedral perpetually re-emerging in the suffused light of early morning. Monet created several groups of paintings exploring the color, light, and form of a single subject at various times of day, but his Rouen Cathedral series was his most intense effort on a single site. He painted there in late winter in both 1892 and 1893, then reworked his thirty canvases from memory in the studio through 1894. He began this example in 1893, working in an improvised studio in the front room of a dressmaker's shop across from the cathedral.

Under Gauguin’s mentorship, the Dutch artist had learned to paint from memory, but now he fought against this tendency. In addition to the interpretations he made of works by Rembrandt, Delacroix, Millet, Doré, and others, he painted interior scenes of the clinic and the asylum garden and completed portraits of doctors.

In March 1886, Van Gogh left his native Netherlands to reunite with his brother, Theo, in the French capital. Soon after, he began meeting with several leading avant-garde artists whose works embodied strong reactions against the Impressionist tendencies that dominated the Parisian art world. In 1887, Van Gogh took up residence in Asnières, a northwestern suburb of Paris, and his encounters with Signac and Gaugin proved catalytic for the painter's developing practice. Gauguin shared Van Gogh's enthusiasm for 19th-century Japanese woodblock prints and emulated their large planes of color in his burgeoning Synthetism and Cloisonnism techniques. The compositional diagonals and strong contours in this painting recall both the distinctive divisions of the picture plane in Japanese landscapes and Gauguin’s simplified adaptation of these features. The scene's striking chromatic contrasts and thickly layered brushstrokes also point to Van Gogh's interest in the experiments with complementary colors Seurat and Signac were making in these years.

He began filling his canvases with views of the region: expansive fields and skies, blossoming fruit trees, interiors and exteriors of houses, depictions of townsfolk and self-portraits, and floral still lifes—works that constituted the iconography of Van Gogh's first great period. By this time, the techniques of Japanese printmaking were deeply ingrained into his creative process, and he conceived the majority of his compositions with what he called his ""Japanese eye."" Stylistic features he borrowed from 19th-century ukiyo-e woodcuts for this still life include the high line of horizon that allows a detailed view of the flowers, the emphasis on the foreground and background to suggest spatial depth, and bright, flat areas of color.

Monet moved to Giverny in 1883 and immediately began to develop the property. For him, the gardens were both a passion and a second artistic medium. His Asian garden was not part of the original estate; it was located on an adjacent property with a small brook, which he purchased and enlarged into a pond for a water garden in 1893. He transformed the site into an inspired vision of cool greens and calm, reflective waters, enhanced by exotic plants such as bamboo, ginkgo, and Japanese fruit trees and a Japanese footbridge. It was not until 1899, however, that he began a series of views of the site, of which this is one. A careful craftsman who reworked his canvases multiple times, Monet was committed to painting directly from nature as much as possible and for as long as he had the correct conditions; thus, he could work on as many as eight or more canvases a day, devoting as little as an hour or less to each. In this case, he set up his easel at the edge of the water-lily pond and worked on several paintings of the subject as part of a single process.

Inspired by the view from his window at the Saint-Paul-de-Mausole asylum in Saint-Rémy, in southern France, where the artist spent twelve months in 1889–90 seeking reprieve from his mental illnesses, The Starry Night (made in mid-June) is both an exercise in observation and a clear departure from it. The vision took place at night, yet the painting, among hundreds of artworks van Gogh made that year, was created in several sessions during the day, under entirely different atmospheric conditions. The picturesque village nestled below the hills was based on other views—it could not be seen from his window—and the cypress at left appears much closer than it was. And although certain features of the sky have been reconstructed as observed, the artist altered celestial shapes and added a sense of glow. Van Gogh assigned an emotional language to night and nature that took them far from their actual appearances.

The message of the painting was more important to Van Gogh than correct anatomy or technical perfection.

In this way, he demonstrated that it was possible to create an image with numerous variations of a single colour, without any loss of eloquence. The sunflower paintings had a special significance for Van Gogh: they communicated ‘gratitude’, he wrote. He hung the first two in the room of his friend, the painter Paul Gauguin, who came to live with him for a while in the Yellow House. Gauguin was impressed by the sunflowers, which he thought were ‘completely Vincent’.

In June, he confided to the painter Emile Bernard: ""But when shall I ever paint the Starry Sky, this painting that keeps haunting me"" and, in September, in a letter to his sister, he evoked the same subject: ""Often it seems to me night is even more richly coloured than day"". During the same month of September, he finally realised his obsessive project. He first painted a corner of nocturnal sky in Cafe Terrace on the Place du Forum, Arles (Otterlo, Rijksmuseum Kröller-Muller).

A few months later, just after being confined to a mental institution, Van Gogh painted another version of the same subject: Starry Night (New York, MoMA), in which the violence of his troubled psyche is fully expressed.

Around 8 July, Vincent mentioned Boch in a letter to his brother Théo: ""I very much like the looks of this young man with his distinctive face, like a razor blade, and his green eyes"". On 11 August, his idea began to take shape: ""I should like to paint the portrait of an artist friend, a man who dreams great dreams, who works like the nightingale sings, because it is his nature to do so. This man will be blond. I would like to convey in the picture my appreciation, the love that I have for him. So I will paint him just as he is, as faithfully as I can [...]. Behind his head, instead of painting the ordinary wall of this shabby appartment, I will paint infinity, I will do a simple background of the richest blue, the most intense blue that I can create, and through this simple combination of the bright head against this rich, blue background, I will obtain a mysterious effect, like a star in the depths of an azure sky"". Two weeks later, Boch sat for Van Gogh. ""Well, thanks to him I have at last the first sketch of this painting that I have dreamt of for so long – The Poet. He sat for me. His fine head with his green eyes stands out in my portrait against a starry sky of deep ultramarine; he wears a short, yellow jacket, a collar of unbleached linen and a colourful tie"". Although he only considered it to be a ""sketch"", Van Gogh framed this work, which he called The Poet.

While completing the series, Monet relocated from the town of Argenteuil to an apartment near the station in Paris.

This caused the cork spacers on the backs of the stretchers to be pressed into the adjacent paintings, creating circular indentations in the surface that are visible along the top edge of this work.

Van Gogh conceived the first Bedroom in October 1888, a month after he moved into his “Yellow House” in Arles, France. This moment marked the first time the artist had a home of his own, and he had immediately and enthusiastically set about decorating, painting a suite of canvases to fill the walls. Completely exhausted from the effort, he spent two-and-a-half days in bed and was then inspired to create a painting of his bedroom. As he wrote to his brother Theo, “It amused me enormously doing this bare interior. With a simplicity à la Seurat. In ﬂat tints, but coarsely brushed in full impasto, the walls pale lilac, the ﬂoor in a broken and faded red, the chairs and the bed chrome yellow, the pillows and the sheet very pale lemon green, the bedspread blood-red, the dressing-table orange, the washbasin blue, the window green.

Van Gogh was apparently inspired by the energy of the city and by his introduction to Impressionism, and he created at least twenty-four self-portraits during his two-year stay in the French capital. This early example is modest in size and was painted on prepared artist’s board rather than canvas. Its densely dabbed brushwork, which became a hallmark of Van Gogh’s style, reﬂects the artist’s response to Georges Seurat’s revolutionary pointillist technique in A Sunday on La Grande Jatte—1884 . What was for Seurat a method based on the cool objectivity of science became in Van Gogh’s hands an intense emotional language. The surface of the painting dances with particles of color—intense greens, blues, reds, and oranges. Dominating this dazzling array of staccato dots and dashes are the artist’s deep green eyes and the intensity of their gaze. “I prefer painting people’s eyes to cathedrals,” Van Gogh once wrote to Theo. “However solemn and imposing the latter may be—a human soul, be it that of a poor streetwalker, is more interesting to me.” From Paris, Van Gogh traveled to the southern town of Arles for fifteen months.

These works replaced the varied contemporary subjects he had painted from the 1870s through the 1890s with a single, timeless motif—water lilies. The focal point of these paintings was the artist’s beloved ﬂower garden, which featured a water garden and a smaller pond spanned by a Japanese footbridge. In his first water-lily series (1897–99), Monet painted the pond environment, with its plants, bridge, and trees neatly divided by a fixed horizon. Over time, the artist became less and less concerned with conventional pictorial space. By the time he painted Water Lilies , which comes from his third group of these works, he had dispensed with the horizon line altogether. In this spatially ambiguous canvas, the artist looked down, focusing solely on the surface of the pond, with its cluster of vegetation ﬂoating amid the reﬂection of sky and trees.

The train station at Saint-Lazare would have been a familiar, meaningful sight to Claude Monet in the 1870s. The terminal linked Paris to Normandy, where the artist developed his technique of painting outdoors in the 1860s. It was also the point of departure for the towns and villages west and north of Paris that the Impressionists frequently visited. Monet completed eight of his twelve known paintings of the Gare Saint-Lazare in time for the third Impressionist exhibition, in 1877, probably displaying them in the same gallery. Monet chose to focus his attention here on the glass-and-iron train shed, where he found an appealing combination of artiﬁ cial and natural effects—the rising steam of locomotives trapped within the structure and the daylight penetrating large, glazed sections of the roof, for instance. Monet’s depictions of the station inaugurated what was to become for him an established pattern of painting a speciﬁc motif repeatedly in order to capture subtle and temporal atmospheric changes, as in his famous series of stacks of wheat . But the Saint-Lazare paintings also represented his last attempt to capture urban life: from this point on in his career, Monet largely devoted himself to landscapes.",art-institute-of-chicago-us,Oil on canvas,60.3 × 80.2 cm (23 3/4 × 31 1/2 in.); Framed: 80.7 × 100.4 × 10.2 cm (31 3/4 × 39 1/2 × 4 in.),https://www.artic.edu/artworks/16571,TRUE,FALSE

The artist was familiar with the landscape, having grown up in the area, but the region changed signiﬁcantly during his lifetime. The expansion of the country’s rail network turned this small, rural ﬁshing village into a seaside resort for tourists. Here, Monet hinted at this transformation. The viewer is immediately drawn to the visible aspects of local life—dark-sailed fishing boats drift in the water, with groups of ﬁshermen, their equipment, and other craft on the shore. The beached boats frame two ﬁgures sitting on the shoreline, highlighted by a few strokes of red and yellow paint: a man in a dark hat and suit looks through a telescope, accompanied by a woman wearing a straw hat with a scarlet ribbon. The presence of this couple—undoubtedly vacationers, given their fashionable attire—changes what might have been a traditional coastal scene into a painting of modern life, one of the artist’s ﬁrst explorations of tourism. Monet began this painting outdoors and revised it later in his studio. Conservation research has revealed that he changed his mind about the composition while he worked: he initially included other tourist ﬁgures and yachts in the scene but later painted over these details, shifting his focus to the ﬁshermen, the aspect of life in Sainte-Adresse that he knew best. Monet’s seascapes from this summer are markedly different from those painted only a few years earlier, and Beach at Sainte-Adresse exempliﬁes his evolving painting technique. It also foreshadows some of the qualities that became characteristic of the Impressionist movement, which is perhaps why Monet chose to show it at the second Impressionist exhibition in 1876, nearly ten years after he painted it.",art-institute-of-chicago-us,Oil on canvas,75.8 × 102.5 cm (29 13/16 × 40 5/16 in.); Framed: 104.1 × 130.2 × 11.4 cm (41 × 51 1/2 × 4 1/2 in.),https://www.artic.edu/artworks/14598,TRUE,FALSE

This was also a retreat from personal and professional pressures. His wife, Camille, had died three years earlier, and Monet had entered into a domestic arrangement with Alice Hoschedé (whom he would marry in 1892, after her husband's death). France was in the midst of a lengthy economic recession that affected Monet's sales. In addition, the artist was unenthusiastic about the upcoming seventh Impressionist exhibition—divisions within the group had become pronounced by this time—and he delegated the responsibility for his contribution to his dealer, Paul Durand-Ruel. Disappointed in the area around the harbor city of Dieppe, which he found too urban, Monet settled in Pourville and remained in this fishing village until mid-April. He became increasingly enamored of his surroundings, writing to Hoschedé and her children: &quot;How beautiful the countryside is becoming, and what joy it would be for me to show you all its delightful nooks and crannies!&quot; He was able to do so in June, when they joined him in Pourville.The two young women strolling in Cliff Walk at Pourville are probably Marthe and Blanche, the eldest Hoschedé daughters. In this work, Monet addressed the problem of inserting figures into a landscape without disrupting the unity of its painterly surface. He integrated these elements with one another through texture and color. The grass—composed of short, brisk, curved brushstrokes—appears to quiver in the breeze, and subtly modified versions of the same strokes and hues suggest the women's wind-whipped dresses and shawls and the undulation of the sea.

During these months, Picasso produced a series of landscapes, heads, and still lifes that are among the most highly acclaimed achievements of early Cubism. Picasso's companion, Fernande Olivier, was the model for the series of heads that the artist produced at this time. In this painting, the contrast between the naturalistic still life in the background and the boldly faceted figure in the foreground illustrates an important stage in Picasso's evolution at the time. A series of still lifes by Picasso that were inspired by the art of Paul Cezanne preceded Picasso's powerful probing into the nature of solid form, which is exemplified here by the treatment of the head. By vigorously modeling the form in a manner that blatantly disregards the rules of illusionistic painting, Picasso conveyed information about the subject's underlying structure, about its development in the round (Olivier's bun, for example, which would normally not be visible from the front, is brought into full view), and a remarkably tactile sense of its projections and recessions. Not surprisingly, these highly sculptural portraits led Picasso to turn, as he did intermittently throughout his career, to actual sculpture upon his return to Paris in the autumn of 1909. The result was the head of Fernande Olivier, an early bronze cast of which is in the Art Institute. In this sculpture, Picasso combined the faceting of the face seen in our painting with the scalloped treatment of the hair found in a drawing from this same period, which is also in the collection of the Art Institute. The artist then energized the head through a dynamic torsion of the neck, replacing the relaxed, fleshy folds in the painting with an emphasis on the taut curve of the back of the neck, as the head bends and twists in space. Although Cubism was to exert an enormous influence on the move toward abstraction among many artists in the early part of this century, Fernande Olivier reminds us that Cubism itself was firmly rooted in an intense study of material reality. This painting was once in the famed collection of expatriates Leo and Gertrude Stein in Paris, and can in fact be seen hanging on the wall of Gertrude Stein's study in a photograph of 1914-15. —Entry, Margherita Andreotti, Art Institute of Chicago Museum Studies , Vol. 20, No. 2, The Joseph Winterbotham Collection at The Art Institute of Chicago (1994), p. 138-139.

On it, a basket of apples pitches forward from a slablike base, seemingly balanced by the bottle and the tablecloth’s thick, sculptural folds.

The landscape’s configuration and color fascinated him. This painting is one of more than a dozen such vistas created by the artist during the 1880s. Cézanne divided the canvas into four zones—architecture, water, mountain, and sky. Although these four elements are seen repeatedly in Impressionist paintings, Cézanne’s work is very different from that of his fellow artists. Whereas their primary purpose was to record the transient effects of light, Cézanne was interested in the underlying structure and composition of the views he painted. Filling the canvas with shapes defined by strong, contrasting colors and a complex grid of horizontal, vertical, and diagonal lines, he created a highly compact, dynamic pattern of water, sky, land, and village that at once refers back to traditionally structured landscape paintings and looks forward to the innovations of Cubism. Using blocklike brushstrokes to build the space, Cézanne created a composition that seems both two- and three-dimensional.

These travels encouraged him to adopt their bold brushwork, daring compositions, and imagery. But he nonetheless continued to incorporate the Romantic subjects of the northern European artists long familiar to him, such as a lone figure at an open window. This combination is powerfully manifested in The Girl by the Window , made soon after his return home to Norway.

The most startling feature of this painting is that he painted it at all. Following the advent of the Realist movement, which grounded art in the here and now, avant-garde artists in France did not pursue religious themes. While Manet was primarily a painter of secular subjects, he was also interested in art history, which led him on at least two occasions to depict the biblical narratives that had compelled artists for many centuries. This work might also have been inspired by the popular 1863 biography Vie de Jésus (Life of Jesus) by the French philosopher and historian Joseph-Ernest Renan, a controversial work that emphasized Christ’s humanity. Here, Manet depicted Jesus at the end of his life, beaten and awaiting cruciﬁxion. The Roman soldiers force him to don a crown of thorns and proffer a reed “scepter” and purple cloak, all intended to ridicule him as “King of the Jews,” a title bestowed ironically by his tormenters. Manet transformed this sacred narrative into a gritty drama that marries realism with theatricality. He presented Jesus frontally, emphasizing his vulnerability and human physicality. Jesus seems exhausted and limp. The canvas’s visible brushstrokes and color palette create a sense of materiality that further evokes a palpable, unidealized Christ, who notably lacks a halo. Is he a holy being emanating divine light or a real man posing under a studio spotlight? The painting caused a scandal in its own time for precisely this ambiguity.",art-institute-of-chicago-us,Oil on canvas,190.8 × 148.3 cm (74 7/8 × 58 3/8 in.); Framed: 240.1 × 196.9 cm (94 1/2 × 77 1/2 in.),https://www.artic.edu/artworks/16499,TRUE,FALSE

Manet’s focus on still lifes coincided with the gradual reacceptance of the genre during the nineteenth century, due in part to the growth of the middle class, whose tastes ran to intimate, moderately priced works. This painting, like many of Manet’s still-life compositions, recalls seventeenth-century Dutch models. The directness of execution, bold brushwork, and immediacy of vision displayed in the canvas, however, suggest why the public found Manet’s work so unorthodox and confrontational. While Fish is indeed an image of “dead nature” ( nature morte is the French term for still life), there is nothing still about the work: the produce seems fresh and the handling of paint vigorous. Further enlivening the composition is the placement of the carp, which offsets the strong diagonal of the other elements. Manet never submitted his still lifes to the official French Salon but rather sold them through the burgeoning network of art galleries in Paris and gave them to friends.",art-institute-of-chicago-us,Oil on canvas,73.5 × 92.4 cm (28 15/16 × 36 3/8 in.); Framed: 108.6 × 127.4 × 12.7 cm (42 3/4 × 50 1/8 × 5 in.),https://www.artic.edu/artworks/44892,TRUE,FALSE

Many Impressionist paintings depict the Café Nouvelle-Athènes on the rue Pigalle, where two tables were reserved for Édouard Manet and his circle—a group that included the painters Edgar Degas , Claude Monet , Camille Pissarro , and Pierre-Auguste Renoir , and the writers Charles Baudelaire and Émile Zola . At first glance, this fashionably dressed young woman appears to have been captured sitting at a favorite café: the marble tabletop, beer mug, and magazine attached to a wooden bar suggest such a setting, and her heavy clothing and kid gloves indicate that she is at an outdoor table and that the weather is cool. However, the floral background is actually one of Manet's paintings and the café a re-creation in his studio. Woman Reading is one of the most Impressionist of Manet’s images; the quick, free brushstrokes and light colors are characteristic of his technique late in his career.

The painting records the last moments of the race as the horses rush past the finish line, indicated by the pole with a circular top.

This may explain why Two Sisters (On the Terrace) is one of the most popular paintings in the Art Institute. Here Renoir depicted the radiance of lovely young women on a warm and beautiful day. The older girl, wearing the female boater’s blue ﬂannel, is posed in the center of the evocative landscape backdrop of Chatou, a suburban town where the artist spent much of the spring of 1881. She gazes absently beyond her younger companion, who seems, in a charming visual conceit, to have just dashed into the picture. Technically, the painting is a tour de force: Renoir juxtaposed solid, almost life-size figures against a landscape that—like a stage set—seems a realm of pure vision and fantasy. The sewing basket in the left foreground evokes a palette, holding the bright, pure pigments that the artist mixed, diluted, and altered to create the rest of the painting. Although the girls were not actually sisters, Renoir’s dealer showed the work with this title, along with Acrobats at the Cirque Fernando and others, at the seventh Impressionist exhibition, in 1882.",art-institute-of-chicago-us,Oil on canvas,100.4 × 80.9 cm (39 1/2 × 31 7/8 in.); Framed: 119.1 × 100.1 × 7.7 cm (46 7/8 × 39 3/8 × 3 in.),https://www.artic.edu/artworks/14655,TRUE,FALSE

Among the enthusiastic crowds at these events were men on the prowl in a world of young female entertainers. But Pierre-Auguste Renoir barely alluded to the unwholesome aspects of this environment, relegating a group of dark-suited men, seated in the front row, to the very top of the composition. “For me a picture . . . should be something likeable, joyous, and pretty,” Renoir insisted. “There are enough ugly things in life for us not to add to them.” Acrobats at the Cirque Fernando reﬂects this worldview as well as the artist’s enchantment with the innocence of childhood. The two circus girls in this painting, Francisca and Angelina Wartenberg, were actually seventeen and fourteen years old, respectively, when Renoir made this painting, although they appear much younger here. Although they were acrobats in the circus, Renoir posed the sisters in costume at his studio, allowing him to capture them in daylight—he feared that the circus’s harsh gas lighting would turn “faces into grimaces.” He portrayed them standing in the middle of the circus ring, having just ﬁnished their act and taking their bows. One sister turns to the crowd, acknowledging its approval, while the other faces the viewer with an armful of oranges, a rare treat that audiences tossed in tribute. Renoir enveloped the girls in a virtual halo of pinks, oranges, yellows, and whites, as if acknowledging the rose-colored lens through which he preferred to view such scenes.

Originally, the work was related to a 1909 commission by the Russian collector Sergei Shchukin, who wanted two large canvases to decorate the staircase of his Moscow home. Matisse proposed three pastoral images, though Shchukin decided to purchase only two works, Dance II and Music (both State Hermitage Museum, Saint Petersburg). Four years later, Matisse returned to this canvas, the rejected third image, altering the idyllic scene and changing the pastel palette to reflect his new interest in Cubism. He reordered the composition, making the figures more columnar, with faceless, ovoid heads. Over the next years, Matisse transformed the background into four vertical bands and turned the formerly blue river into a thick black vertical band. With its restricted palette and severely abstracted forms, Bathers by a River is far removed from Dance II and Music , which convey a graceful lyricism.

He often stayed at the Hôtel Mediterranée, a Rococo-style building he later fondly termed &quot;faked, absurd, delicious!&quot; Interior at Nice is perhaps the most ambitious of a series of images the painter created using the hotel as a backdrop. The pink-tiled floors and yellow, arabesque-patterned wall-paper are present in many of these works, as are the skirted dressing table, oval mirror, shuttered French window, and balcony. The balcony in fact was one of the artist’s favorite themes, allowing him to link internal and external space into a continuum structured by patterns and modulated light. Additionally, Matisse often included a young woman somewhere in the scene. Here, his favorite model at the time, Antoinette Arnoux, plays an important role.

Matisse was recognized by critics as the leader of this group. This composition is one of contrasts—the pale palette and light brushwork in the upper half of the picture are juxtaposed with the darker colored, heavily painted lower half; the firmly planted pose of the female figure is contraposed with the almost-ﬂeeing figure of the male; and the red vegetables grown near Paris are set near ceramic objects from exotic, faraway places.

In doing so, the formal properties of art—such visual elements as line, color, and composition—assumed a primary role in its production. After World War I, many artists, including Piet Mondrian, believed that abstract art could contribute to a more harmonious society by communicating in a universal, visual language. In the wake of the war's destruction, artists associated with De Stijl (meaning, &quot;the style&quot;) in the Netherlands recognized the need for a break with the past, as well as a new aesthetic language to correspond to their utopian vision of the world. In 1917 Mondrian joined the De Stijl movement and began to develop a purely visual language of verticals and horizontals, restricting his compositions to predominantly off-white grounds divided by black rectilinear lines that framed smaller blocks of primary colors.",art-institute-of-chicago-us,Oil on canvas,57.5 × 55.6 cm (22 5/8 × 21 7/8 in.),https://www.artic.edu/artworks/65821,TRUE,FALSE

The landscape and features of the figures are similar to Leonardo's Madonna of the Rocks, and in typical Leonardesque fashion, the figures' heads incline slightly to the left. However, Virgin and Child was later attributed to a member of Leonardo's circle named Francesco Napolitano (active 1500) because of its resemblance to his Madonna and Child with St. Sebastian and St. John the Baptist in Zurich, Switzerland. Virgin and Child has not been widely accepted as a work of Napolitano; however, he was certainly a member of Leonardo's circle. The Sforzesco Castle, the seat of Milan's ruling Sforza family, appears in the background.

Motivet til dette billede er netop hotelv√¶relset med dets vindue ud mod stranden og havet. Kontrasten mellem ude og inde, lys og m√∏rke spiller en stor rolle i billedet, men ogs√• kontrasten mellem to forskellige udtryksformer. Interi√∏rets indre er skildret i en abstrakt, fladebundet stil, der peger tilbage mod Matisses billeder fra de forudg√•ende √•r.

Den lille by, smukt beliggende mellem en klippefuld kyst og bakker med oliventr√¶er og vinmarker, fik en s√¶rlig betydning for Henri Matisse, der kom her f√∏rste gang i sommeren 1905. Her var billigt at bo og f√• forstyrrelser. Kort efter ankomsten sendte han et postkort til sin yngre malerven Andr√© Derain: ‚ÄúJeg kan ikke insistere nok p√•, at et ophold her er absolut n√∏dvendigt for Deres arbejde‚Äù. Derain sluttede sig til Matisse, og de to kunstnere kastede sig ud i vilde maleriske eksperimenter i byen og bakkerne omkring Collioure; dette landskabsbillede er et af dem. Med sine st√¶rke farvekontraster, energiske penself√∏ring og dekorativt bugtende linjer frig√∏r maleriet sig fra en rent afbildende funktion og formidler i stedet en subjektiv oplevelse. Billederne fra Collioure vakte stor opm√¶rksomhed, da de senere p√• √•ret blev vist p√• den parisiske efter√•rssalon og lagde grunden til Matisses renomm√© som en af modernismens v√¶sentligste pionerer (50 v√¶rker du skal se p√• SMK).",smk-statens-museum-for-kunst-copenhagen-denmark,Olie p√• l√¶rred,460 x 550 mm; 680 x 768 x 96 mm,https://open.smk.dk/artwork/image/KMSr79,TRUE,FALSE

Kunstv√¶rket best√•r af ulmende kul√∏rer, og det har en melankolsk og m√•ske l√¶ngselsfuld stemning. Matisses maleri handler altid meget om, hvordan farver kan digte.

After years of rigorous art training in Mexico City, he traveled throughout Europe from 1907 to 1910. In l9l2 Rivera settled in Paris, where he befriended other emigré avant-garde artists, such as Amedeo Modigliani and Piet Mondrian. During World War l, he became a leading member of a group of Cubists that included Albert Gleizes, Juan Gris, and Jean Metzinger. The subject of this portrait is Rivera’s lover at the time, Marevna Vorobëv-Stebelska, a Russian-born painter and writer. Photographs of the sitter, which show her distinctive bobbed hair, blond bangs, and prominent nose, reveal Rivera’s gifts of observation. Seated in an overstuffed armchair, she turns away from the book she holds in her lap, as if momentarily—perhaps angrily—distracted. Vorobëv-Stebelska is stylishly dressed in a gold-brocade bodice, white sleeves, and a dress whose shape hints at a pair of crossed legs. To her right appears a green, faux-marble form that may be a fireplace, and behind her is a schematically rendered window and shutters. In this Synthetic Cubist composition, Rivera used color to suggest spatial recession, making the planes meant to be closer to the viewer brighter than those at further remove. The painting’s somber and rich color harmonies recall the palette of Gris. Following World War I and the Russian Revolution, Rivera, like many other artists in Paris, rejected Cubism as frivolous and inappropriate for the new age.

Working in Abiquiu, New Mexico, O’Keeffe began around 1963 to capture the endless expanses of clouds she had observed from airplane windows during trips all over the world. Beginning with a relatively realistic depiction of small white clouds on a three-by-four-foot canvas, she progressed to more stylized images of the motif on larger surfaces. O’Keeffe wrote: ""I painted a painting eight feet high and twenty-four feet wide—it kept me working every minute from six a.m. till eight or nine at night as I had to be finished before it was cold—I worked in the garage and it had no heat—Such a size is of course ridiculous but I had it in my head as something I wanted to do for a couple of years."" In 1970 Sky above Clouds IV was scheduled to be included in a retrospective of O’Keeffe’s work at the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, the Art Institute of Chicago, and the San Francisco Museum of Art. After being shown in New York and Chicago, the painting was determined to be too large to enter the doors of the museum in San Francisco. It thus remained on loan to the Art Institute for more than a decade, while the artist and public-minded collectors of her art arranged for it to join the museum’s permanent collection. The special relationship between O’Keeffe and the Art Institute began in 1905, when she enrolled as a student at the School of the Art Institute. Her first museum retrospective was organized here in 1943. Later, as the executor for the estate of her husband, the pioneering American photographer and art dealer Alfred Stieglitz, O’Keeffe presented the Art Institute with an important group of modernist works, including a number of her own, many of which are on view in the galleries of American art.

Early in his career, he began to utilize the silk-screen process to transfer photographed images to canvas, creating multiple portraits of celebrities including Marilyn Monroe, Elvis Presley, and Jacqueline Kennedy, as well as duplicated images of mass-produced products such as Campbell’s soup cans and Coca-Cola bottles. In this example from his Mao series, Warhol melded his signature style with the scale of totalitarian propaganda to address the cult of personality surrounding the Chinese ruler Mao Zedong (1893–1976). Nearly fifteen feet tall, this towering work mimics the representations of the political figure that were ubiquitously displayed throughout China. Warhol’s looming portrait impresses us with the duality of its realistic qualities and its plastic artificiality.

By the early 1960s, screenprinting had become the favored medium for commercial printing jobs, such as labels and signage. It was used to quickly reproduce photographic images on almost any flat surface. By 1962 Warhol had begun using it to put repeated images on his canvases—images that he had previously painted painstakingly by hand. Because Warhol had not finessed the process, his printing “mistakes” became a signature. In 1967 he began publishing limited-edition print portfolios in his studio under the aegis of Factory Editions. Marilyn was the first such portfolio, consisting of ten images made from the same 1953 publicity photograph of Marilyn Monroe in the film Niagara , which Warhol transformed with intentionally off-register printing and garish combinations of psychedelic colors. Daylight fluorescent colors, better known as Day-Glo colors, were invented in the 1930s, and by the 1960s had become integral to the graphic vocabulary of Pop art. While a conventional bright color reflects 80 to 90 percent of its color, a Day-Glo color appears to reflect more than 300 percent of its color. It is no wonder then that art historian Robert Rosenblum observed that Marilyn’s face “seems perpetually illuminated by the afterimage of a flashbulb.” With this method and presentation, Warhol and his work became synonymous with Pop Art.",art-institute-of-chicago-us,Color screenprint on cream card,91.4 × 91.4 cm (36 × 36 in.),https://www.artic.edu/artworks/150044,FALSE,FALSE

His breakthrough artistic moment came when he took the commercial printing process of photo-emulsion silkscreen and applied it to canvas. This allowed him to reproduce the same image over and over, quickly and efficiently. Warhol celebrated both products and personalities, giving equal weight to soup cans and movie stars. He began using images of Elizabeth Taylor in early 1962. Her beauty and allure fueled interest in the sordid tragedies of her personal life, which included failed marriages, love affairs, and a near-death experience that occurred while filming Cleopatra (1963). Liz #3 [Early Colored Liz] comes from a series of thirteen canvases, each with the same image of Taylor set before a jewel-toned background. Warhol used a preexisting publicity still of Taylor as his source material, which he cropped and then enlarged so that the actress literally fills the screen. Her signature features — her eyes and lips — have been accentuated with colors that hover between vibrant and vulgar.

Well before Hokusai's time, Mount Fuji had been worshipped as a sacred mountain, and in his day it was a destination for pilgrims from all over Japan.While known for his novel and dynamic compositions, Hokusai's greatest strength was undoubtedly his remarkable draftsmanship.

When the Art Institute acquired Inventions of the Monsters in 1943, the artist wrote his congratulations and explained: ""According to Nostradamus the apparition of monsters presages the outbreak of war. The canvas was painted in the Semmering mountains near Vienna a few months before the Anschluss [the 1938 political union of Austria and Germany] and has a prophetic character. Horse women equal maternal river monsters. Flaming giraffe equals masculine apocalyptic monster. Cat angel equals divine heterosexual monster. Hourglass equals metaphysical monster. Gala and Dalí equal sentimental monster. The little blue dog is not a true monster."" Inventions of the Monsters has an ominous mood. It is rife with threats of danger, from the menacing fire in the distance to the sibylline figure in the foreground with an hourglass and a butterfly, both symbols of the inevitability of death. Next to this figure sit Dalí and his wife and muse, Gala. With his native Catalonia embroiled in the Spanish Civil War, the artist surely felt great anxiety over a world without a safe haven, a world that indeed had allowed for the invention of monsters.

The combination of cool painted plaster and silky mink tufts illustrates the Surrealist interest in uniting different elements to spark a new reality. For the Surrealists, the best means of provoking this revolution of consciousness was a special kind of sculpture that, as Dalí explained in a 1931 essay, was “absolutely useless . . . and created wholly for the purpose of materializing in a fetishistic way, with maximum tangible reality, ideas and fantasies of a delirious character.” Dalí’s essay, which drew upon the ideas of Marcel Duchamp’s readymades, inaugurated object making as an integral part of Surrealist activities. Influenced by the work of Sigmund Freud, Dalì envisioned the idea of a cabinet transformed into a female figure, which he called an “anthropomorphic cabinet.” Venus de Milo with Drawers is the culmination of his explorations into the deep, psychological mysteries of sexual desire, which are symbolized in the figure of the ancient goddess of love.",art-institute-of-chicago-us,Painted plaster with metal pulls and mink pom-poms,98 × 32.5 × 34 cm (38 5/8 × 12 3/4 × 13 3/8 in.),https://www.artic.edu/artworks/185184,TRUE,TRUE

By engaging with contemporary psychology and especially theories of the subconscious, and playing with form, he developed a style based on whimsical allusions to reality and lyrical, fancifully colored compositions. In January 1940, he began a series of twenty-three works on paper that later became known as The Constellations , of which this is an example. Composed on identically sized sheets of paper over twenty-one months, this remarkably poetic suite was created from January 1940 to September 1941, under the duress of World War II, when Miró and his family moved from France to his native Spain to avoid the advance of the Nazis. About the “Constellations” he stated: “If the interplay of lines and colors does not expose the inner drama of the creator, then it is nothing more than bourgeois entertainment. The forms expressed by an individual who is part of society must reveal the movement of a soul trying to escape the reality of the present. . . . in order to approach new realities, to offer men the possibility of rising above the present.” Miró chose a stiff, textured watercolor paper for the series, and began each sheet by sanding the surface, then rubbing his freshly cleaned oil paint brushes over the paper, sometimes blending it with thinned gouache so that the two incompatible liquids created diaphanous, cloud-like pools. In these suggestive fields, he constructed his visual story, covering the sheet with hourglass shapes and a multitude of forms suggesting crescents, eyes, stars, and triangles, linked by thin black lines to evoke an imaginary celestial world. Each picture took about a month to complete, demonstrating his intense engagement with the images. Miró titled the works as if each were a poem, and the background suggests night and day, alternately, evoking imaginary atmospheres, and characters in space.",art-institute-of-chicago-us,"Opaque watercolor with watercolor washes on ivory, rough textured wove paper",45.9 × 38 cm (18 1/8 × 15 in.),https://www.artic.edu/artworks/79593,FALSE,FALSE

To release images of this higher realm, the Surrealists embraced automatism, a spontaneous working method much like free association. Miró experimented with automatism: “Even a few casual wipes in cleaning my brush,” he said, “may suggest the beginning of a picture.” Between 1925 and 1927, his experiments unleashed a revolutionary series of works called the “dream paintings,” which straddle abstraction and representation in freely moving, calligraphic compositions. In The Policeman , a large canvas from this group, two biomorphic shapes spring to life as a policeman and a horse, their forms defined by thinly applied white paint against a neutral ocher ground. The form on the left has sprouted five buds that act as fingers, and both forms extrude curves that suggest torsos or mouths.

Then, he translated these compositions into large abstract paintings, with multicolored, amorphous forms rendered in silhouette.

The beauty of her translucent skin, the pearls in her hair, the luxurious fabrics—all contrast with the horror of what is about to happen. The main source for the story of Lucretia is the *History of Rome* (Book I, 57 – 59) by ancient Roman historian Titus Livius. The legendary Lucretia was the virtuous wife of the nobleman Lucius Tarquinius Collatinus. After her rape by Sextus Tarquinius, the son of the King of Rome, she called on her father and her husband for vengeance and then, while proclaiming her innocence, stabbed herself to death. Anger and grief over Lucretia’s death led to a rebellion that brought down the corrupted monarchy and made her a martyr for freedom. Lucretia became an enduring symbol of female strength, and her story likely had personal resonance for the artist: like Lucretia, Artemisia Gentileschi had experienced sexual violence as a young woman. Artemisia often depicted *donne forti* (strong women) in her work, in this way shaping her artistic persona as an independent and successful painter in a world dominated by men. She approached her subjects with great empathy and translated their experiences into emotionally complex paintings. Artemisia painted Lucretia at least four times during her career, and in all but one of the surviving examples she portrayed the isolated figure of Lucretia in the moment just before she plunges the dagger on her breast. Three poems written in Venice in 1627 celebrated a painting of Lucretia by the hand of Artemisia. The author has not been identified with certainty, but he was likely Giovan Francesco Loredan, who was part of a close-knit group of writers, artists, musicians, and patrons who were associated with Artemisia during her Venetian sojourn (1626/27 – 1630). Artemisia’s portrayal of the elegant and sophisticated heroine hint at a profound engagement with the artistic legacy of sixteenth-century Venetian art, therefore leading to an identification of our painting with the work praised in the aforementioned poems.",the-getty-los-angeles-us,"Oil Paint (Paint), Canvas (Textile Material)",Height: 92.9 cm; Width: 72.7 cm; Depth: 6.35 cm; Height: 119.38 cm,https://www.getty.edu/art/collection/object/109Q8G,TRUE,FALSE

After living in Venice and Rome, where he absorbed the late Mannerist style, the Greek-born artist settled in the Spanish city of Toledo in 1577 to work on the high altar of the convent church of Santo Domingo el Antiguo. The church of this ancient Cistercian convent was being rebuilt as the funerary chapel of a pious widow, Doña Maria de Silva. In El Greco’s grand design, the Assumption was surmounted by a representation of the Trinity and was ﬂanked by two side altars decorated with paintings of the Adoration of the Shepherds and the Resurrection. The visionary imagery of the Assumption and the Trinity aptly expressed the patron’s hope of salvation. Here the Virgin ﬂoats upward, supported on the crescent moon that is symbolic of her purity, while the boldly modeled heads of the crowd of apostles gathered around her empty tomb express amazement and concern.

He paid a man to pose in his father’s prayer clothes and then painted him, limiting his palette primarily to black and white, as befit the solemnity of the subject. This portrait is noteworthy for the simplicity of its execution; nonetheless, its striking patterns, abstract background, and the slightly distorted features of the model demonstrate Chagall’s absorption of modern trends, especially Cubism. Chagall often painted variants or replicas of works he particularly loved. The Art Institute’s Praying Jew is one of three versions of this composition. He painted the original canvas in 1914, and when he traveled back to Paris in 1923, he took this painting with him. He learned upon his return that much of the work he had left in France had been lost during World War I.

Initially head of the bookbinding department, Klee made his greatest contribution as a lecturer on the theory of form in art for the basic design course. There, he developed his ideas about the “polyphony” of painting—the simultaneous effect of formal elements that produces “a transformed beholder of art.” Klee was also a trained musician and shared with many artists of the early twentieth century the idea that music was the key to producing a new, abstract art. He was interested in the temporal character of music and its possible translation into forms of art. Works like Sunset reflect the principles of rhythm: linear structures, forms, and tonal values are orchestrated into a measured, vibrating image. To produce such a harmonious effect, Klee layered an intricate pattern of dots over a neutral background. Abstract, geometric, and overlapping shapes balance with recognizable forms, such as the schematic face in the upper left and the red sun and arrow in the lower right. The resulting composition—balancing stillness and movement, shallowness and depth—relates to Klee’s larger project of looking to music to produce an art that “does not reproduce the visible, but makes visible.”",art-institute-of-chicago-us,Oil on canvas,46.1 × 70.5 cm (18 1/8 × 27 3/4 in.),https://www.artic.edu/artworks/61608,FALSE,TRUE

Three years later, he helped pioneer a general migration of artists to the neighborhood of Montparnasse, which remained the center of avant-gard activity in the city until World War II. Scores of artists lived there, and many of them shared a Jewish heritage—including Modigliani and his friend the Lithuanian-born sculptor Jacques Lipchitz. Lipchitz commissioned Modigliani to paint this portrait on the occasion of his marriage to the Russian poet Berthe Kitrosser, as a way of helping his troubled friend financially. The double portrait is one of only three in the artist’s oeuvre and, according to Lipchitz, took two days to paint. Modigliani made about twenty drawings on the first day; the next day, he declared the picture finished. At the modest price of what Lipchitz remembered as “ten francs per sitting and a little alcohol,” however, he persuaded Modigliani to work on the portrait for another two weeks in an effort to provide more financial assistance to his friend. Despite Modigliani’s exceptional talent, his work found a market only after his death in 1920, which was hastened by tuberculosis and his legendary bohemian lifestyle.",art-institute-of-chicago-us,Oil on canvas,81.3 × 54.3 cm (32 × 21 3/8 in.),https://www.artic.edu/artworks/27987,TRUE,TRUE

He led a notoriously bohemian life, shortened by a self-destructive use of alcohol and drugs. Modigliani produced his finest paintings between 1914 and his premature death in 1920. Within a limited range of subjects, mainly portraits and nudes, he developed a highly distinctive style of sensitively elongated forms. In this portrait, Modigliani's emphasis is on a strong formal structure dominated by the grid in the background and the echoing curves of the sitter's hat, shoulders, and features. There is none of the pathos often associated with his work. The artist seems instead to have invested this portrait with a note of ironic detachment, even humor, reflected in both the title of the painting (which refers to Madame de Pompadour, mistress of King Louis XV of France) and the expression of amused inscrutability worn by the sitter. Were painter and sitter perhaps both amused by the flamboyant hat? Modigliani's skill in rhyming forms, while at the same time keeping us visually interested and slightly off-balance, is evident throughout the picture, which resonates with the lessons of Paul Cezanne , Cubism, and African sculpture. The sitter for this portrait may well have been Beatrice Hastings, an English poetess who was Modigliani's mistress at the time. Because of the artist's tendency to generalize his sitter's features, however, a comparison of this portrait with others of Hastings is inconclusive. —Entry, Margherita Andreotti, Art Institute of Chicago Museum Studies , Vol. 20, No. 2, The Joseph Winterbotham Collection at The Art Institute of Chicago (1994), p. 150-151.

He thoroughly absorbed the art of Renaissance painters in Rome and Venice as well as recent advances in early Baroque painting, which allowed him to dominate the artistic scene back in his native Antwerp.

All of these titles, together with some distinctive motifs in the painting, may refer not only to Afro-Cuban Santería beliefs, but also to the European mystical tradition of Ramon Llull (c. 1235-1316), Robert Fludd (1574-1637), and Jakob Böhme (1575-1624). The title Ladder to the Light , in particular, conveys the notion of rising stages toward enlightenment. The diagonal of the shaft that traverses the composition vertically reclls a leaning ladder, and the elongated white diamond on the right may allude to crossing beams of light, a shape that also appears in Fludd's diagrams, created by crossing triangles of projection. These references to a Western tradition of initiation and enlightenment are here brilliantly absorbed into the dominant imagery based on Santería beliefs. Often highly abstract and ambiguous, these Santería-inspired elements are set dramatically against a ark, looselt painted background, haunted by ghostly, imprecise shapes. The diagonal shaft, which is also like a staff, may represent the ""lightening spear"" of Changó, the Yoruba god of thunder. It is crossed by horned and ax-headed spikes, which may also stand for the rungs of the ladder named in the picture's title. The little round shapes on the shaft, suggesting schematic heads, may refer to Elegguá, an orisga (divinity or spirit who mediates between humans and nature) often present in Lam's work. One of Elegguá's roles, that of guardian of the roads, may be evoked by the brown horizontal strip that crosses the picture behinf the central shaft. The brown, angled form that juts across the upper-right portion of the canvas suggests the presence of a huge figure, whose elbow is represented supporting the shaft or spear. The pink, fleshy forms at the upper right and lower left may be versions of the horse-woman, a motif found frequently in Lam's work. This horse-woman figure derives from the Santería notion that the worshiper is possessed by the orisha in a manner comparable to a horse mounted by it's rider (see Julia P. Herzberg, ""Wifredo Lam,"" Latin American Art 2, 3 [Summer 1990], p. 20). The evidently sexual quality of the pink forms, however, hints at a more personal kind of illumination. There is the suggestion of a breast at the upper right and of buttocks or breasts at the left, forms that rhyme with the circular ""heads"" on the horizontal shaft and thus introduce a double reading of these round shapes. — Entry, Dawn Ades, Surrealist Art: The Lindy and Edwin Bergman Collection at the Art Institute of Chicago , 1997, p. 162-163.",art-institute-of-chicago-us,Oil on linen,150.2 × 100.6 cm (59 1/8 × 39 13/16 in.),https://www.artic.edu/artworks/12408,TRUE,FALSE

He boarded a ship in Marseilles in March 1941 and arrived in Havana sometime in late July or early August. For Lam, however, this was not the exile that it was for André Breton or André Masson, both of whom went to the United States. Lam was returning home, and from this moment he rediscovered an artistic universe for which his long sojourn in Europe had, in a sense, been preparing him. Born of a Chinese father and a mother of African and Spanish origin, he had left Cuba in 1923 for Spain, where he had acquired formal, academic training, and eventually moved to Paris in 1938, where his encounter with Pablo Picasso was decisive. He absorbed the modernist interest in African art, which did not hamper him in any sense from responding directly to the particular Afro-Cuban traditions of his homeland. This rich legacy continued to imbue his work, even after 1952, when he once again established his main residence in Paris. Not only did Lam draw inspiration from the tropical nature that overwhelmed him on his return to Cuba, but he also reached his homeland at a propitious moment, at a time when Cuban scholars were beginning to study Afro-Cuban religion and culture, thus richly encouraging his own predisposition toward the ""primitive."" In Cuba, groundbreaking research on Afro-Cuban culture was being carried out by Fernando Ortiz and Lydia Cabrera, both of whom Lam came to know. As Valerie Fletcher has written, ""Because slavery had not effectively ceased until 1886, African religions, languages, mythologies, rituals, music, and dance remained particularly strong in Cuba"" (Valerie Fletcher, ""Wifredo Lam,"" in Washington, D.C., Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Crosscurrents of Modernism, Four Latin American Pioneers: Diego Rivera, Joaquín Torres-García, Wifredo Lam, Matta , 1992, exh. cat., p. 179). Lam may have drawn, furthermore, upon family memories, for his godmother, Mantonica Wilson, was a priestess of the Yoruba-derived religion Santeria. There was, then, a transformation in Lam's work after 1941; Gerardo Mosquera argued that this change was not a formal one: the artist was to continue always to be in debt to Picasso, Gonzàlez, Matisse, African geometricism and the classical tradition of Western art. What was important was the change of direction. ... under the impulse of Surrealism he began to develop his personal world in such a way that it led to a more introspective handling of those forms. The rediscovery of Cuba brought about the eclosion of everything African in his own cultural formation, the emergence of his Caribbean Weltanschauung and of its relationship with his natural and social environment. (Gerardo Mosquera, ""Modernity and Africania: Wifredo Lam on His Island,"" in Barcelona, Fundació Joan Miró, Wifredo Lam , 1993, exh. cat., p. 178) Lam also benefited from the fact that Surrealism was far more closely allied to the Negritude movements in the Antilles, in its attitude to poetry, society, and politics, than to the negrophilia fashionable in Paris in the 1920s and early 1930s. In Martinique, Breton, Lam, and Masson, on their voyage from France in 1941, had met the poet Aimé Césaire, who had, with several others, just founded the review Tropiques (published in Fort-de­France from 1941 to 1945). A Surrealist ""avant Ia lettre,'' Césaire's poetic formation, with its emphasis on the writings of Arthur Rimbaud and Lautréamont, had much the same roots as that of Breton. Breton, in turn, was impressed by the quality of the texts in the first issue of Tropiques and lent his full support to its contributors. As Césaire's wife, Suzanne, later explained, Surrealism was the ""tight-rope of our hope"" (see her essay ""1943: Le Surréalisme en nous,"" Tropiques 8-9 [Oct. 1943), p. 18). Especially noteworthy is Benjamin Péret's contribution to a 1943 issue of Tropiques in the form of a preface to Césaire's poem ""Cahier d'un retour au pays natal,"" which was illustrated by Lam. This text eloquently illuminates Lam's work as well as Césaire's poem. ""For the first time,"" Péret wrote, a tropical voice resounds in our language, not to mediate an exotic poetry, trinket of bad taste and mediocre interior, but to burst out in an authentic poetry issuing from the rotting trunks of orchids and the electric butterflies devouring carrion ... His poetry has the sovereign allure of the great breadfruit trees and the obsessive accent of the voodoo drums. In it, black magic heavy with poetry is opposed to the point of rebellion against the religions of the slavers where all magic is mummified, all poetry dead forever. (quoted in Tropiques 6-7 [Feb. 1943], p. 60) This study belongs to a series of works related to The Jungle , Lam's masterpiece and major statement about his rediscovery of African Cuba. The Bergmans bought the work directly from Lam, whom they visited in Havana in 1956. In a letter to Edwin Bergman of April 1956, Lam called the work ""etude for La Jungle ,"" a confusing bilingual title probably resulting from an inadequate attempt at translation, for Lam did not speak English. On November 13 of that year, Lam wrote that the painting had been sent to Chicago, but was not responsive to Edwin Bergman's request, in an earlier letter of August 21, for information about its ""meaning and symbolism."" ""About this picture I have very little to say,"" Lam wrote, ""because in other letters that I have written to you I have explained the materials that I have used in it"" (earlier correspondence, now lost, had identified the picture for customs purposes). The Jungle was apparently painted in twenty days, between December 1942 and January 1943 (see Antonio Nuñez Jiménez, ""Genesis de la jungle,"" Plástica latino­américana: Revista de la Liga de Arte de San Juan [Mar. 1983], p. 18, cited in Julia P. Herzberg, ""Wifredo Lam: The Development of a Style and World View, the Havana Years, 1941-1952,"" in New York 1992-93, p. 50 n. 36). The works leading up to it include fifty preparatory gouaches, shipped to Pierre Matisse in October 1942 for Lam's first New York exhibition, and studies subsequent to these gouaches, executed between October and December. In a letter to Edwin Bergman of June 28, 1956, Lam referred to this study as being ""of the period of The Jungle ,"" and it is closely related to two other works probably dating from these months: Woman (1942, private collection; New York 1992-93) and Untitled (1942, Maryland, Dr. Alberto Martinez­Piedra; New York 1992-93). Although Lam described the Bergman piece as ""one of the preparations for La Jungle "" (letter to Edwin Bergman of April 1956), to which it bears a close general resemblance, there is no exact counterpart to its subject in the larger work. There appear to be several figures standing in the center of the study—judging from the two faces, three arms, and multiple feet—but Lam may have intended only one ""hybrid,"" a common motif in his work. The most central of the figures holds a pair of scissors in her left hand and her hair in her right hand, with her arms draped at her sides. The second figure, slightly behind the first and to the left, reaches a grotesquely enlarged hand behind her head to grasp testicle-shaped fruit. Complete in its own right, the study is related both to the figure carrying giant scissors and to the more centrally placed long-masked figure in the final version. While in The Jungle the scissors are held upright at the upper edge of the painting, in this study the big, crab-claw blades with the finely curled finger holes are held in a threatening horizontal position. The clear threat of castration in the study is made more specific with the detail of the thumb protruding between the blades of the scissors. In spite of the spherical breasts and long hair, there is a certain confusion of gender in these figures. Their bodies are entangled with the dense screen of exuberant vegetation, the plant stems echoing their limbs, the leaves and fruit their kneecaps, breasts, and buttocks. Photographs of Lam's garden in the Havana suburb of Marianao show the origins of some plant details in the tall trunks and globular fruit of the papaya (see Fouchet 1976, p. 15, figs. 1-n). Lam disturbingly juxtaposed in this picture the fecundity of nature with the threat of emasculation. The way in which his imagery acts as a projection of male fears and desires finds a parallel in one of the first great pictures of ""primitivized"" sexuality, Picasso's Demoiselles d'Avignon, an image of five prostitutes (1907, New York, The Museum of Modern Art; New York, The Museum of Modern Art, Pablo Picasso: A Retrospective , 1980, exh.cat., p. 99, ill.). The latter painting was clearly an important source for The Jungle ; Lam indeed suggested a similar identity for his own figures. Contrasting his Jungle with that of Henri Rousseau, Lam explained: He was a formidable painter! But he doesn't belong to my natural chain. He doesn't condemn what happens in the jungle. I do. Look at my monsters, the gestures they make. The one on the right offers her haunch, obscene like a great prostitute. Look also at the scissors being brandished. My idea was to represent the spirit of the Blacks in the situation in which they found themselves. I showed, through poetry, the reality of acceptance and of protest. (quoted in Fouchet 1976, p. 199) The sexual exploitation to which Lam refers, at a time when Cuba was the playground for the West, also acts for him as an allegory for cultural and political exploitation: I decided that my painting would never be the equivalent of the pseudo-Cuban music for nightclubs. I refused to paint cha-cha-cha. I wanted with all my heart to paint the drama of my country, but by thoroughly expressing the Negro spirit, the beauty of the plastic art of the Blacks. In this way I could act as a Trojan horse that would spew forth hallucinating figures with the power to surprise, to disturb the dreams of the exploiters. (quoted by Fletcher in Washington, D.C. 1902, pp. 170-81) The sexualized imagery expresses both the material exploitation of Cuba and the threat of emasculation posed to the West by the more ""primitive"" society. Lam's relationship with his Cuban contemporaries highlights the radical nature of his imagery. Some of his subjects were not new: artists such as Marcelo Pogolotti had treated explicitly political themes during the 1930s in a modernist manner, especially the exploitation of the sugarcane workers, and Mario Carreno painted Sugarcane Cutters in 1943 (New York, The Museum of Modern Art; New York 1992-93, p. 52, ill.) in a dynamic, Futurist style. Lam collaborated with his contemporaries on projects in Havana, but refused to exhibit in the ""Modern Cuban Painters"" show at The Museum of Modern Art, New York, in 1944, apparently as a result of a personal difference with José Gómez Sicre, the author of the book on Cuban painting that accompanied the show (see Giulio V. Blanc, ""Cuban Modernism: The Search for a National Ethos,"" in New York 1992-93, p. 67; and José Gómez Sicre, Cuban Painting of Today , Havana, 1944; Sicre's book was not an exhibition catalogue; a checklist of the show ""Modern Cuban Painters"" was published with an essay by Alfred Barr, Jr., in the Museum of Modern Art Bulletin 11, 5 (1944], pp. 8-14) . But Lam's embrace of Afro-Cuban themes, such as the Santeria-inspired figures featured in this and other Bergman works, opened up a new perspective, as Gerardo Mosquera has argued, and influenced a number of artists, notably René Portocarrero in his Little Devil (Diablito) series (Mosquera, in Barcelona 1993, pp. 173-82).",art-institute-of-chicago-us,"Tempera, with touches of pastel, on tan wove paper, laid down on canvas",177.4 × 121.9 cm (69 7/8 × 48 in.),https://www.artic.edu/artworks/118704,TRUE,FALSE

Because Rapture was made prior to the events of September 11, 2001, and the renewed tensions between the United States and the Middle East, current viewers’ reactions are informed by associations about Islam and Iran that would likely not have affected perceptions of the work at the time of its 1999 debut in a focus exhibition at the Art Institute. Rapture is a meditation on the gender politics of Islam. These relationships, embodied by the image of the veiled woman, are often subjected to reductive caricature in the West. Although Neshat actively resists stereotypical representations of Islam, her artistic objectives have not been explicitly polemical. Rather, her work recognizes the complex intellectual and religious forces shaping the identity of Muslim women throughout the world. Rapture is an installation of two synchronized black-and-white video sequences that are projected on opposite walls; large in scale, they evoke cinema screens. Working with hours of footage and a team of editors, the artist constructed two parallel narratives: on one side of the room, men populate an architectural environment; in the other sequence, women move within a natural one. The piece begins with images of a stone fortress and a hostile desert, respectively. The fortress dissolves into a shot of over one hundred men—uniformly dressed in plain white shirts and black pants—walking quickly through the cobblestone streets of an old city and entering the gates of the fortress. Simultaneously, the desert scene dissolves into a shot of an apparently equal number of women, wearing flowing, full-length veils, or chadors, emerging from different points in the barren landscape. As the video progresses, the men busy themselves with a variety of mundane, sometimes absurd activities that contradict the intended function of the space. On the other side of the installation, the women chant, pray, and later, having made their way across the desert, launch a boat into the sea with six of their own aboard. In Rapture , Neshat self-consciously exploits entrenched clichés about gender and space: namely, the equation of woman with irrational, wild nature and man with rational, ordered culture. The video installation is itself a study of gendered group dynamics, with the viewer literally positioned between two opposing worlds. The players in Neshat’s surreal, segregated narratives are deployed in a syncopated rhythm of action and nonaction, mutual recognition and nonrecognition, advance and retreat. Rapture exists as a poignant reflection on the rootless, unsettled psychology of exile. As an Iranian expatriate living in the United States, Neshat maintains a critical distance that has allowed her to locate both the poetics and the power of the veil. At the same time she celebrates the strength and beauty of Islamic women, she remains keenly aware of the horrors of repression.",art-institute-of-chicago-us,"Two-channel black-and-white video, sound (projection); 13 min. loop",,https://www.artic.edu/artworks/184206,FALSE,FALSE

He had studied at China’s most progressive art academy, training in both Western oil painting and Chinese ink painting and calligraphy. Despite his education, Zao’s arrival in the cosmopolitan French capital prompted for him a more tangible, as well as conceptual, reckoning with Eastern and Western aesthetics. However, it was not until he traveled to the United States, where he viewed Abstract Expressionist paintings for the first time, did the artist embrace exclusively the atmospheric abstraction for which he became known. After returning to Paris, Zao began to create sweeping, large-scale compositions and swiftly rose to prominence among a circle of fellow Paris-based abstract painters interested in lyrical and intuitive mark making, including American Joan Mitchell and German-born Hans Hartung. In The Night Is Stirring (Anger) (La Nuit remue [colère]) , Zao built up layers of jewel-toned color, activated by touches of lurid red and a torquing column that seems to climb up the center of the canvas. While his dark, inky brushstrokes call to mind Chinese calligraphy, still more traditional Chinese painting is reflected through Zao’s manipulation of the tropes of the landscape format, which emphasizes the rhythms and energies of nature more than a strictly realistic approach. Suspended between the conventions of Chinese landscape painting and the materiality of Western oil painting, Zao’s canvas occupies other in-between states as well; it is, for example, an abstract work that suggests not only landscape in general but nightfall more specifically.

His paintings combine African motifs, Islamic calligraphy, and Euro-American modernism. A member of the revolutionary Khartoum school, El-Salahi contributed to the intellectual climate of postcolonial Sudan and the making of a national art and aesthetic in the 1960s. His work is characterized by the use of earthy colors, the transformation of Arabic letters into abstracted forms, and the merging of folk art with modern abstract painting. The artist once described the “Pandora’s box” of animal, plant, and, more specifically, skeletal and masked forms that seemed to open for him as he deconstructed and abstracted the shapes of written language; he was also inspired by the structure of West African masks. A radically abstracted figure—holding a pomegranate in its right hand—plays a prominent role in Male-Female Figure and the Pomegranate . Just as striking, however, is the material surface of the work, with its array of intricate textures. This painting exemplifies the artist’s innovations of the 1960s both in its compositional complexity and its evident engagement with process. El-Salahi used enamel and oil paint as well as a technique he called “tickling,” which involved manipulating the canvas with his fingers to create the appearance of depth. Discussing this painting, he has said, “I did it in Sudan, at a time when I was focusing on . . . somber relations. I started by building the image with a mixture of white oil and enamel paints, then treated it with a glaze of burnt sienna and black oil paints mixed with linseed oil.

The sitter—identiﬁable through his coat of arms, personal motto, and initials on the back of the panel—is Jean Gros, an administrator to the future Duke of Burgundy. This portrait depicts him at the outset of a successful career, during which he amassed a large fortune and led a privileged life. Rogier van der Weyden presented the half-length ﬁgure against a plain, dark background, which accentuates his features and his expressive hands. This gesture indicates that the sitter’s prayerful gaze was originally directed at another panel with an image of Mary and the infant Jesus, now in the Musée des Beaux-Arts in Tournai, Belgium; Gros’s coat of arms is on the back of that panel as well. This type of diptych, which was intended to suggest continuous prayer and to record the donor’s features, was probably ﬁrst made for royalty around 1400, but Van der Weyden revitalized it in the mid-ﬁfteenth century, creating similar diptychs for patrons at the highest level of the Burgundian court.

To convey the close connection between mother and son, Rogier van der Weyden exploited the qualities of oil paint, a highly manipulable medium that can be blended while wet.

It is likely that this panel was intended for the cell of a monk in an unknown monastery. The Carthusians were particularly devoted to the Passion and Crucifixion of Christ, and devotional images were provided for each monk’s cell. The Carthusian order was founded by Saint Bruno in 1084 with the purpose of providing the strictest separation from the world. The first Carthusians were dedicated to contemplation through silence, prayer, poverty, penance, and almost continuous occupancy of a solitary cell. The solitary life could only be maintained through the establishment of separate cell houses. Each community of monks was limited to the apostolic number of 12, though exceptions were sometimes made.

Reiset (Inv. ms) avant d'être reclassé à Mathis Gothart Nithart, dit Grunewald, en suivant une proposition avancée avec réserve par H. A. Schmid ('Die Gemälde und Zeichnungen von Matthias Grünewald', 2 vol., Strasbourg, 1907-1911, vol. 2, p. 269-270, pl. 1), qui y a vu une étude préparatoire pour un bourreau d'une 'Dérision du Christ' ou d'un 'Couronnement d'épines'.

Meller ('Drawings by Francesco del Cossa in the Uffizi', in Master Drawings, 3, 2, 1965, p. 20, note 43), l'attribution de la feuille à Amico Aspertini a soulevé une vive controverse (voir in M.

I, p. 45), ce dessin fut rangé parmi les feuilles de l'école florentine du XIVe siècle par F. Reiset (Inv. ms). Par la suite, il fut attribué tour à tour à des artistes toscans actifs durant la seconde partie du siècle : O. Siren (dans 'Jahrbuch der Preussischen Kunstsammlungen', 1906, p. 219) le donna à Niccolo' di Pietro Gerini (connu en 1366 - mort en 1415), en le rapprochant des fresques réalisées par l'artiste à Prato (San Francesco, chapelle Migliorati) ; B. Berenson ('The Drawings of the Florentine Painters', Chicago, 1938, II, n° 2756F) à Spinello Aretino (1350/1352-1410). R. Bacou proposa d'y reconnaitre le dessin d'un artiste anonyme florentin du milieu du XIVe siècle proche de Maso di Banco ( ?-1348), où de l'école de Rimini (voir dans cat. exp. Dessins florentins du Trecento et du Quattrocento, Paris, Louvre, 1952, n° 62 ; cat. exp. Dessins florentins de la collection de Filippo Baldinucci (1625-1696), Paris, Louvre, 1958, n° 2). Si M. Gregori (dans 'Bollettino dell'Accademia degli Euteleti della Città di San Miniato', 33, 1961, 13-16, p. 103) persista à y voir la main d'un artiste florentin plus tardif, actif à la fin du XIVe siècle, l'attribution à Maso fut reprise et confirmée par B. Degenhart et A. Schmitt ('Corpus der italienischen Zeichnungen 1300-1450', Berlin, 1968, I, n° 24), qui rapprochèrent la feuille tant de la 'Glorification de saint Thomas' d'Andrea di Bonaiuto à Florence (Santa Maria Novella), que d'un saint Julien de Maso à Florence (Santo Spirito) et d'un saint Antoine du même artiste à New York (The Metropolitan Museum of Art). En 1978, L. Bellosi (« Introduction », dans cat. exp. I Disegni antichi degli Uffizi. I tempi del Ghiberti, sous la direction de F. Bellini, Florence, Galleria degli Uffizi, 1978, p. XIII-XIV) affirmait le premier que cette feuille était, parmi toutes celles conservées de cette époque, la seule à pouvoir donner une idée de la façon dont dessinait Giotto. Quelques années plus tard, en 1985, l'étude sur le dessin original, le poussa à attribuer la feuille à Giotto lui-même (« Su alcuni disegni italiani tra la fine del Due et la metà del Quattrocento », dans 'Bollettino d'Arte', 1985, n° 30, p. 5-10). Cette attribution, confirmée par A. Conti (« Giotto e la pittura italiana della prima metà del Trecento », dans 'L'Arte medievale in Italia e nell'Occidente europeo', sous la direction de L. Castelfranchi Vegas, Milan, 1993, p. 95 ; « Prefazione alla terza edizione », dans 'Giotto e la sua bottega', sous la direction de Giovanni Previtali, Milan, 1993, p. 17, repr. fig. 507), a été par la suite généralement acceptée (A. Rossi, « La miniatura da Dante a Boccaccio... », dans 'Giornate di studio in ricordo di Giovanni Previtali', (Sienne, Università degli Studi, décembre 1998 ; Pise, Scuola Normale Superiore, mai 1999) sous la dir. de F.

Témoignage exceptionnel de la technique du dessin 'in carta tinta', abondamment décrite par Cennino Cennini dans son 'Libro dell'Arte' au tout début du Quattrocento, la feuille ne trouve pas des correspondances exactes dans l'œuvre du maitre. Pourtant, sa parenté avec les figures des apôtres du 'Jugement dernier' ou de la 'Cène' peints dans la chapelle des Scrovegni à Padoue, ou encore avec le 'Dieu le père en trône' prévu pour l'arc triomphal de la chapelle, parait évidente : la monumentalité des figures, les volumes des formes et la lumière, notamment rendue grâce à l'usage du blanc de céruse, sont tout à fait comparables.

Le Louvre conserve de nombreux dessins préparatoires pour ce tableau (entres autres : RF 35350 à RF 35390). La commande pour la décoration de l'hémicycle de la salle des Prix dans le nouveau bâtiment de l'Ecole des beaux-arts à Paris est confiée à Delaroche par Adolphe Thiers en septembre 1836. Elle fut achevée en juillet 1841. Le projet de Delaroche s'inscit dans la vision d'ensemble de l'établissement, avec Duban à l'architecture et Peisse à la sculpture et répond à la volonté de rénover les études artistiques en élargissant le champ des références historiques. Delaroche était membre de l'Académie des beaux-arts, professeur à l'Ecole et partie prenante de cette modernisation de l'enseignement. Le mur courbe mesure 3,90 mètres de haut sur 24,70 mètres de long, soit en longueur près de cinq fois 'L'Apothéose d'Homère' d'Ingres et près de quatre fois 'L'Ecole d'Athènes' de Raphaël au Vatican qui apparaissent comme les prototypes les plus évidents. Delaroche ne voulait pas représenter l'art uniquement sous forme allégorique mais aussi, sous la protection incontestée des maîtres de l'Antiquité, les artistes de la période gothique à l'âge classique. Les différentes disciplines enseignées à l'Ecole (peinture, sculpture et architecture) devait aussi figurer. 'L'Hémicycle' de Delaroche apparait comme un manifeste esthétique de l'éclectisme des artistes des années romantiques (Claude Allemand-Cosneau in cat. d'exp. ""Paul Delaroche, un peintre dans l'Histoire"", Paris, Nantes, Montpellier, éditions de la RNM, musée des Beaux-Arts, musée Fabre, 1999, p.105 à p.129). La modernité des visages des modèles qui ont posé pour des artistes qui ne leur ressemblent pas contraste avec leurs costumes d'époque. Il existe une autre étude de Fra Angelico, plus complète, conservée au Louvre (RF 35316) avec un manteau différent. Delaroche traite les draperies avec une particulière habileté, usant tour à tour de l'estompe et de fermes accents pour marquer certains plis (L.-A. Prat in cat. d'exp.

Ces légendes ne se retrouvent dans aucun des textes publiés les plus connus.

Il laissa tomber un peu d'encre dessus ... » (A. Bruel, « Les Carnets de David d'Angers », Paris, 1958, t. I, p. 329). Un dessin conservé à Weimar (Klassik Stiftung, Graphische Sammlung) offre une version moins détaillée du même sujet, alors qu'un autre, presque semblable, à l'exception du motif du hibou remplacé par un vautour, est conservé à Vienne (Albertina Museum).

De leurs conversations naquit un projet qui devait, dans les années suivantes, donner lieu à des peintures sur papier transparent à mettre en scène accompagnées de musique, de nuit au clair de lune, à la lumière d'une bougie passant à travers une boule de verre remplie d'eau ou de vin blanc. Seuls les dessins en ont conservés la trace. Il s'agit d'allégories musicales illustrant les correspondances entre la musique et la peinture, destinées à la grande-duchesse Alexandra Feodorovna et dédiées au jeune tsarévitch Alexander. La première composition symbolisant la musique profane représente deux jeunes filles tenant l'une une guitare et l'autre une mandoline, qui jouent près d'une harpe, dont le son se dégage au contact de celui des deux autres instruments. Trois autres compositions furent réalisées par Friedrich, mais sont perdues. L'une évoquant la musique céleste, est connue par son calque conservé au musée de Hambourg, l'autre ayant pour cadre une forêt, est une méditation sur le temps et la mort, le thème de la dernière composition est la musique sacrée dont le calque se trouve à Chemnitz (F.

At the age of 14, he moved to the Travancore Palace where he was taught watercolour painting by the palace painter Rama Swamy Naidu. Theodor Jenson, a British painter who was a guest of the Palace, introduced the techniques of oil painting to Varma. He began exhibiting his work and won several medals at international exhibitions, including one at Vienna and two at Chicago. He is best known for his images of Hindu gods and goddesses and scenes from India's great epics. In a break with Indian tradition, Ravi Varma used human models to create a form for his vision of Hindu gods.

As one of the most acclaimed painters and educators in modern China, he influenced the development of 20th-century Chinese painting. Xu was born in a village in Yixing, Jiangsu province. He studied painting in his hometown and Shanghai before having an opportunity to go to Europe. In the period from 1919 to 1927, he studied at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris, acquiring a solid foundation in the Western academic tradition. On returning to China, Xu became a powerful force for the introduction of Western art through his teaching, writing and exhibitions; his influence was rivalled only by Liu Haisu and Lin Fengmian. After 1949, with the founding of the People’s Republic, he settled in Beijing and became Director of the new Central Academy of Fine Arts and Chairman of the National Artists’ Association. Horse is Xu's favourite subject matter. This painting reflects the artist's principal artistic concern, namely, to bring together the Western academic tradition of painting and Chinese aesthetics through ink techniques. The work was made in summer 1944, shortly before the artist had a medical operation. It was given by him to Miss Ellen Wilkinson (1891-1947), a prominent member of the Labour cabinet in Clement Attlee's government.

Van Gogh drew and painted many portraits of Roulin, a postal worker in Arles, where Van Gogh lived from 1888 to 1889. In letters and pictures, Van Gogh idealized Roulin, regarding him as both a man of the people and a sage. Facing frontally, Roulin is pushed close to the picture plane, with his eyes looking slightly wistfully to the side. Van Gogh's energetic lines describe Roulin's full beard, his facial structure, and his somewhat crooked nose. With the dark, thick lines of a reed pen, Van Gogh hatched the vibrating coat and cap.

He probably began by drawing the Scheveningen woman on the verso. Possibly dissatisfied with its murky effect, he may also have cut down the sheet to its current dimensions. Recycling the high-quality Torchon paper, he turned the sheet over and painted this luminous scene in watercolors as he watched the women at work in the field. With the whites blowing from the fence, van Gogh retained the freshness of the moment and created a sense of motion within an otherwise still landscape.

After completing Guernica , an expression of the horrors of war and a critique of fascist tyranny, Picasso continued to be drawn to the subject of agonized grief. Between June and December 1937, he undertook a series of drawings, paintings, and prints known as The Weeping Women , in which he focused and elaborated on two figures first presented in Guernica . The figure in this print may also represent the artist’s lover, the Surrealist photographer Dora Maar. In Weeping Woman I , Picasso drew inspiration from contemporary events and sixteenth- and seventeenth-century religious imagery. He modernized the traditional theme of the Virgin Mary lamenting the death of her son. The importance Picasso accorded this etching is suggested not only by its size—it was the largest plate he had yet attempted—but also by the energy he invested in it. He developed the finished print through seven independent states. It seems that he felt the need to work and rework this image, perhaps in an effort to exorcise the demons of war and his difficult relationship with Maar.",art-institute-of-chicago-us,"Drypoint, aquatint, and etching, with scraping, on copper in black on ivory laid paper",Plate: 69.5 × 49.7 cm (27 3/8 × 19 5/8 in.); Sheet: 77.4 × 56.8 cm (30 1/2 × 22 3/8 in.),https://www.artic.edu/artworks/135430,FALSE,TRUE

This large, haunting etching, The Frugal Meal , was one of the last works of his Blue Period (1901–4), a time when the struggling artist’s palette was dominated by the color blue, then symbolically associated with melancholy—the mood in which he portrayed his array of poor, ill, and outcast characters. Completed just after Picasso settled permanently in France, moving into a dilapidated Montmartre tenement nicknamed the Bateau-Lavoir, or “Washerwoman’s Boat,” this austere etching brings together two subjects that fascinated him—couples in cafés and the experience of the blind—with a high degree of refinement. The man’s emaciated face is in profile, while the woman stares directly at the viewer, emphasizing her companion’s blindness. The angular bodies and elongated fingers of the two figures reflect the scarcity of both their meal and their means.

This large, haunting etching, The Frugal Meal , was one of the last works of his Blue Period (1901–4), a time when the struggling artist’s palette was dominated by the color blue, then symbolically associated with melancholy—the mood in which he portrayed his array of poor, ill, and outcast characters. Completed just after Picasso settled permanently in France, moving into a dilapidated Montmartre tenement nicknamed the Bateau-Lavoir, or “Washerwoman’s Boat,” this austere etching brings together two subjects that fascinated him—couples in cafés and the experience of the blind—with a high degree of refinement. The man’s emaciated face is in profile, while the woman stares directly at the viewer, emphasizing her companion’s blindness. The angular bodies and elongated fingers of the two figures reflect the scarcity of both their meal and their means. The Frugal Meal , which was only Picasso’s second attempt at printmaking, reveals the artist’s extraordinary gift for draftsmanship and his remarkable facility with new media and techniques.",art-institute-of-chicago-us,Etching on zinc in black on cream wove paper,Image/plate: 48 × 38 cm (18 15/16 × 15 in.); Sheet: 65.5 × 50.8 cm (25 13/16 × 20 in.),https://www.artic.edu/artworks/63246,FALSE,FALSE

artwork_0001945,Head of a Boy,pablo-picasso,painting,1905-6,,"Created during Pablo Picasso's Rose Period (1904–6), this drawing features a warm palette and thin delicate lines. It might have been created during a summer that Picasso spent in Gósol, a Catalan village in the Spanish Pyrenees. The sheet presents an adolescent with pensive lips, almond-shaped eyes, and a dreamy expression—all characteristics that recur throughout the artist's depictions of figures around this time.

Incredibly inventive in each medium with which he worked, he learned sugarlift aquatint from the greatest intaglio pinter of the time, Rober Lacourière. A mixture of sugar syrup and ink is used to draw on a copper plate. When dry, the entire plate is covered with a varnish that is impervious to acid and put in warm water. As the sugar melts, it lifts the varnish off, exposing the copper plate where the artist has drawn. These areas are then aquatinted; fine particles of acid-resistant resin are deposited on the plate and heated so they adhere to the surface. Next, the plate is immersed in acid, which bites into the plate in tiny pools around each particle. When the plate is printed, the resulting image resembles a freely executed, grainy wash drawing with rich blacks and subtle gray tones. Picasso's prints are often autobiographical, forming an intimate visual diary of his thoughts and experiences. The Egyptian is a portrait of Françoise Gilot who appeared in his work repeatedly after the artist met her in 1943. In this image he abstracted the figure developing such ideas as describing the subject from multiple points of view simultaneously.

Since Picasso did not originally create these plates as a unified set, they address several themes, including the legend of the Minotaur. In classical mythology, this fierce monster with a human body and a bull's head was trapped in a labyrinth by the king of Crete until it was slain by the Athenian prince Theseus. The Minotaur was a potent symbol for the Surrealists, an important group of artists in the 1930s, for whom the creature suggested irrational, unconscious impulses. The Minotaur assumes many guises in the Vollard Suite , reflecting many aspects of Picasso's complex personality. Alternately violent and tender, a carouser and a lusty lover, the Minotaur is also pictured wounded and dying. Unhappy with his wife, dancer Olga Koklova, in 1927 Picasso met the beautiful Marie-Thérèse Walter.

In 1958, at the age of 77, Picasso produced his first great multicolored linoleum cut, Portrait of a Lady, after Cranach, the Younger , for which he cut six linoleum blocks, one for each color. These were then carefully registered as they were printed. Finding this a laborious process, Picasso devised an entirely new method of color printing for linoleum cuts, which he used for over 100 prints by 1963. Using a single block and printing the colors one by one from the lightest to the darkest, Picasso cut out more of the design with each color. For Luncheon on the Grass he first cut away the few areas that were to remain white and the entire edition of 50 impressions was printed in beige ink. Next, the areas to remain beige were cut away, and the block was inked with brown, which was printed over the beige.

In September 1940 Rosenberg and his family moved from Nazi-occupied France to New York where he had offices at 79 East 57th Street. Rosenberg is best known for promoting early modern painters in France and facilitating the migration of French pictures to the USA during the first half of the 20th century. With Rosenberg's help, Picasso and his wife Olga Koklova became neighbours of Paul Rosenberg and his wife Marguerite at 23, rue de la Boétie, after Rosenberg and Picasso came to a business agreement in 1918 making Rosenberg Piccasso's representative with first choice of his new work. Over the next twenty years the Rosenbergs were often the subjects and recipients of Picasso's drawings and paintings Rosenberg first published Picasso's designs for Le Tricorne as a set comprising one signed etching and sixty-three reproductions (thirty-one with 'pochoir' or stencilled colouring).

artwork_0002014,Le Train Bleu,pablo-picasso,painting,1924,"https://framemark.vam.ac.uk/collections/2010EK3884/full/843,/0/default.jpg","This front cloth was created for the Ballets Russes season coinciding with the Olympiad at the Théâtre des Champs Élyséss, Paris, and was first seen on 26 May 1924. Diaghilev commissioned a fanfare from Auric to be played when it was first revealed. The British dancer Anton Dolin, for whom the ballet, Le Train bleu , was created, recalled that it was when the company appeared at the London Coliseum on 24 November 1924 that the cloth was allocated to the ballet by which it is now known. A front cloth is a visual overture seen after the ‘tabs’ or red curtain rises in a western theatre. It is usually accompanied by a musical overture. Its purpose is to establish an appropriate mood for the production that follows but it does not necessarily contribute to the work’s narrative. A front cloth (sometimes called a drop curtain or drop cloth) may be a painting which has been enlarged if no individual will appear in front of it (which is disastrous for scale). In respect of Le Train bleu the music composer, Darius Milhaud had included an overture to musically establish the light-hearted mood of the ballet. The ‘Train Bleu’ front cloth was a copy of Pablo Picasso’s The Two Women Running on the Beach (The Race) painted in Dinard in 1922 which Diaghilev has seen in the artist’s studio. The original is small in size 34 x 42.5 cm but in 24 hours Diaghilev’s scenic artist Prince Alexander Schervashidze enlarged the image to 6.78 x 8m on a canvas 10 x 11m – the wide border enabling the cloth to fit within the proscenium arch of stages varying in size. Picasso was so impressed by the fidelity of the copy that he signed and dedicated the curtain to Diaghilev. When acquired for the V&A it was publicised as the 'largest Picasso in the world' but this is not accurate. The front cloth for Parade (1917) which has no border is 16 x 10m and Picasso was more involved in its painting (see the photograph by Lachman S.5401-2009). This is held at the Pompidou Centre, Paris. A third Picasso-designed cloth, that for The Three-Cornered Hat (1919), cut down to the central panel so appearing to be just a vast painting is displayed at the New York Historical Society. Le Train bleu was a fashionable portrayal of beach and sporting life in the 1920s, witty and satiric as well as chic. Its final performance by Serge Diaghilev’s Ballets Russes was on 13 May 1925 at the Grand Teatro del Liceo, Barcelona. With many other productions the cloth passed to the Diaghilev and de Basil Ballet Foundation Ltd who were responsible for its sale. It had been displayed at Serge Lifar's Ballets Russes de Diaghilev 1909-1929 at the Musee des arts Decoratifs, Paris April-July 1939. Prince Alexander Schervashidze (1867-1968) was an artist, stage designer and noted scenic artist. The grandson of Abkhazian ruler Sefer Ali-Bey, he was employed by the Mariinsky in St Petersburg 1907-1918 moving to France after the Russian Revolution. He worked with both Diaghilev and de Basil's Ballets Russes companies and painted several of the theatre cloths in the V&A's collections including the backcloth for Barabau based on a painting by Maurice Utrillo (1925) S.454-1980 and the backcloth and two borders Protée (1938) designed by Georgio de Chirico S.1096 to 1098-1983.",victoria-and-albert-museum-london-uk,G; o; u; a,Height: 1000 cm (approximately); Width: 1100 cm (approximately),https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O171462/,TRUE,FALSE

The impresario Serge Diaghilev had spotted Massine in Russia in 1914 and brought him into his company, the Ballets Russes, as a successor to Nijinsky. He developed into an outstanding dancer and one of the most important choreographers of the 20th century, devising ballets with character and style. Picasso drew this portrait in Rome where Jean Cocteau, the deviser of the ballet, persuaded Picasso and Satie to meet to work on the piece. Although Picasso intensely disliked travelling, he agreed to leave his Paris studio to go with Cocteau where they joined Diaghilev and Massine, and Picasso showed them the preliminary models of his settings.

Although his large output included landscapes, genre paintings, and the occasional still life, he focused on biblical and historical paintings and on portraits. As an extension of these interests, the artist studied the effect of a single figure, made dramatic through the use of costume and rich, subtle lighting. Rembrandt collected costumes to transform his models into characters. Here, the gold chain and steel gorget suggest an honored military career, while the plumed beret evokes an earlier time. The broad black mass of the old man’s torso against a neutral background is a powerful foil for these trappings. The face is that of a real person, weathered and watchful, glowing with pride and humanity. The unidentified sitter, once thought to be the artist’s father, was a favorite model, appearing in many of the artist’s early works. The confident execution suggests that the young Rembrandt completed this picture about 1631, when he had left his native Leiden to pursue a career in the metropolis of Amsterdam; perhaps he wished to use this work to demonstrate his skill in a genre that combined history painting and portraiture.",art-institute-of-chicago-us,Oil on panel,83.1 × 75.7 cm (32 3/4 × 29 3/4 in.); Framed: 105.1 × 99.5 cm (41 3/8 × 39 3/16 in.),https://www.artic.edu/artworks/95998,TRUE,TRUE

Over the course of his long career, he made over 80 self-portraits in oil, in chalk, in pen and ink and wash, and in etching. A large portion of these self-examinations were created while he was a young man, and served to spread his fame, his name and image, while advertising his abilities in portraiture and dramatic expression. But perhaps Rembrandt's most soul-searching and moving images date from the end of his career, characteristically, his self-scrutiny was first considered carefully in etching, before being pursued in painting. Unpretentious, the image Self Portrait at a Window, Drawing on an Etching-Plate reflects a traditional portrait type used since the 15th century. Not striking a pose, the artist is caught in the middle of his most intimate and natural activity, etching on a plate resting on a folded piece of cloth on top of several books. In this particularly fine impression of the finished print, Rembrandt's gaze rivets the viewer with a soul-searching energy that seems capable of fueling his late, great painted investigations. Noted Rembrandt scholar Mariët Westermann has observed ""by its sheer extent, his portraiture production inaugurated a type of pictorial autobiography... including diaries, memoirs, and philosophical investigations"" reflective of ""the new valuation of the individual…underpinned by the Protestant Reformation.""[1] Philosopher René Descartes published his famous treatise on 'the nature of the human self' ('I think, therefore I am') in Rembrandt's native Leiden in 1637. Westermann has conjectured that ""Rembrandt's incessant representation of his face and body suggests a Cartesian belief in the actuality and relevance of the self.""[2] When Rembrandt created Self-Portrait at a Window, Drawing on an Etching-Plate , in 1648, it had been nine years since his last major self-portrait etching, the arrogant and famous Self Portrait Leaning on a Sill of 1639 , which echoed the Renaissance courtier portraits of Raphael and Titian. The reasons for this significant hiatus have been cause for speculation by various Rembrandt scholars. It had been a time of great turmoil for the artist: his son Titus was born in 1641, but in 1642 his beloved Saskia had died; Nursemaid Geertge Dircx's insistence on marriage led to lawsuits throughout the decade, resulting in her incarceration. Finally the comforting companionship of Hendrickje Stoffels, introduced to the household about 1648, restored balance to Rembrandt's life. Christopher White remarked on Rembrandt's general reluctance to look at himself during the decade of the 1640s.[3] Perry Chapman suggested that Rembrandt's sudden interest in landscape, about 1640, ""coincided with his suspension of self-portrayal… the solitude of nature served as a alternative form of self-examination.""[4] Created just a year after the subtle and elegantly individual etched portraits of Jan Six and Ephraim Bonus of 1647, this self-portrait seems more sober and much more introspective. Wearing a plain black hat with high crown and simple studio tunic, the artist seems less gracious and slightly obdurate. Despite appearances, Rembrandt has not yet encountered sobering financial difficulties. It is worth noting that 1639, the year of that aggrandizing earlier self-portrait, was the year in which Rembrandt contracted to purchase his expensive house on the Sint Antonisbreestraat for 13,000 guilders. In 1647, his and Saskia's marital estate had been estimated at 40,750 guilders, and the precipitous decline of his fortunes would not be apparent for several years. Therefore, Christopher White suggests ""his new introspective mood must have been prompted by personal and artistic reasons, which must have inspired the magic of psychological interpretation. Earlier he had depicted himself from the outside inviting us to be his spectators, but now he studies himself from within, and we feel ourselves intruders in this frank and intimate self-analysis in a mirror, in which one is as near to reading the mind as is humanly possible in a visual medium. The look is piercingly powerful and we see the man himself and not his expression.""[5] Erik Hinterding noted that the image is built up less with lines than from a range of shades,[6] not unlike the elaborate gradations achieved in the portraits of Six and Bonus, or Rembrandt's contemporary masterpiece, Christ Preaching , known as The Hundred Guilder Print . Thanks to eight known examples of the unfinished first state,[7] it is possible to study Rembrandt's working method in creating such a complex medley of intaglio processes. He seems to have used etching to lay in the subject with a dense network of lines, but relied on drypoint to define the forms, and tiny flecks to suggest the face. Indeed, the lines of the visage may not have fully printed until the finished second state, in which in other areas he used a combination of etching, drypoint and engraving so well blended that no single method is easily apparent [8] Rembrandt even used the engraver's burin to shade his left hand so that the cuff is highlighted, and a fine line of drypoint to outline the right arm and the window. In this second state, which Rembrandt finally deemed to be ready to go out into the world, he added a scrim of cloth at the top of the window on which he inscribed his name—an apt reminder of how important light always was for him as an artist, as well as how critical it was for him to be able to modulate the light in his workshop. Christopher White has said ""in signing it, he must have been aware that he had completed one of the key works of this period of his life... though he made two more self-portraits in etching, this is undoubtedly the greatest and most searching. From now on, this analysis was to be seen in the moving series of painted self-portraits….""[9] Rembrandt made only minor corrections of additional burin work in the third state. In the fourth state the foul-biting apparent in the open window has been transformed into a landscape. Scholars are divided as to the authenticity of this landscape, but there is no question that the fifth state, already very dry and worn, is posthumous.10] [1] Mariët Westermann, Rembrandt, London, 2000, pp. 9–11.

In this fourth state, slashing strokes obscure the spectators visible in the earlier version, creating a tenebrous setting that focuses attention on Christ bathed in celestial light.

It depicts the climactic moment of the Book of Tobit, an apocryphal book of the Old Testament, in which, instructed by the archangel Raphael, Tobias heals his father Tobit's blindness by rubbing his eyes with fish gall. With spontaneity, a deft hand, and deceptive simplicity in his mark-making, Rembrandt depicts an intimate family scene including the archangel, Tobias, Hannah, and Sarah around a seated Tobit. Hannah’s spectacles, a unique detail among images of the scene created by Rembrandt and his circle, further thematizes sight. Rembrandt’s most innovative addition to the story centers on Tobias, who concentrates intensely to use a scalpel, rather than fish gall, to perform a cataract operation on his father’s left eye.

Rembrandt imposed his characteristic realist tendencies on a more detailed, formal, and stylized model, bringing the shah to life with especially fine pen strokes on the face and shoes mixed with evanescent brown ink washes around the figure that introduce a dynamic interplay of light, shade, and figure.

Rembrandt was an extremely innovative printmaker who experimented continuously. He understood that in etching he could obtain varied effects by controlling the inking and wiping of the plate and by printing on different types of paper. For this rare, early impression, Rembrandt carefully wiped the plate clean so that a thin layer of tone would unify the work and create the illusion that the figure is emerging from a shadowy background.

Drypoint produces blurred lines and rich, velvety shadows, but these effects are lost as the plate wears. A limited number of rich impressions exist like this fine example of the fifth state, which demonstrates how Rembrandt redefined the expressive potential of printmaking.

She stands nude, squeezing her breast with one hand while holding a large snake behind her with her other hand. The snake, the headdress, and her bared breast suggest that Rembrandt meant to depict Cleopatra, although recent scholars have suggested that the figure has certain aspects of Eve. In fact, Rembrandt used this drawing as the basis for his depiction of Eve in his drawing and subsequent etching *Adam and Eve* of 1638. Rembrandt applied red chalk energetically, describing the swell of the woman's belly with strong horizontal strokes. Vertical shading along her legs conveys her body's taut strength.

He eliminated parts, giving the viewer no more than was necessary to see and feel what he himself saw and felt. Even though this view along the Schinckel River is topographically accurate and scholars have identified the house with the tower, it is Rembrandt's economy of means that makes the drawing enchanting. Rembrandt suggested space, light, and atmosphere by relying on blank paper and using a few exquisitely placed accents. A delicate wash over fine, short strokes creates a blurred and luminous effect in the mass of trees. A fine dotting technique further animates this area, giving the sense of a slight breeze passing across the treetops.

Despite their looseness, his lines present the figures in the three-quarter body and profile head view common in Indian painting. A contemporary of Rembrandt known for his building campaigns and as a patron of art, the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan is recognizable from his characteristic dress and face--and the aureole, which distinguished portrayals of Mughal rulers beginning with his father's reign.

As always, Rembrandt drew only what was essential. His animated line moved vigorously across the sheet, creating rich and varied effects of texture and surface.

The butler, who learns that he will be restored to his position, leans forward, hands clasped, listening intently. Joseph's predictions for these two came true, and his interpretation of Pharaoh's dream saved all of Egypt two years later. As with most of his compositional studies of religious subjects, Rembrandt probably made this drawing not as a preparatory study for a project but for its own sake.

Cyrus was momentarily bewildered, but the worried faces of the priests in the background confirm that Daniel has exposed their deception. This story of Daniel's dramatic exposure of the king's idol-worship derives from the apocryphal portion of the Book of Daniel. Light illuminates the figures of Cyrus and Daniel, highlighting their dramatic encounter. Rembrandt contrasted the king's grandeur with Daniel's humility.

artwork_0002513,Abraham dismissing Hagar and Ishmael,rembrandt,painting,1640,"https://framemark.vam.ac.uk/collections/2006AM2230/full/843,/0/default.jpg","CAI.78 is signed and dated Rembrandt f. 1640, and was generally accepted as an autograph work until1973. However, the earliest documented reference of 1671 to what appears to be CAI.78 already attributed it to 'a disciple of Rembrandt'. In vol. 3 of the Corpus of Rembrandt Paintings produced by the Rembrandt Research Project (1989) it is identified as 'A work probably executed in Rembrandt's workshop in 1640, perhaps attributable to Ferdinand Bol'. Rembrandt van Rijn (1606-1669) was a Dutch painter, draughtsman and etcher. His name is now practically synonymous with the period known as ‘Holland’s Golden Age.’ He ran large workshops in Leiden and later in Amsterdam and was widely imitated in his own time and for centuries following. Ferdinand Bol (1616-1680) was one of his students. While this painting was described in the 18th century as Abraham dismissing Hagar and Ishmael, from 1966 it was identified as the Departure of the Shunammite Woman, on the assumption that the woman on the donkey represents the woman who, after the death of her son, went to the prophet Elisha to ask for his help (2 Kings, 4, 24). A re-examination of the painting, scholarship and documents surounding this works suggest that the earlier identification is probably correct. The painting and composition adhere in most respects to scenes of Abraham dismissing Hagar and Ishmael and closely resembles Rembrandt's etching of the subject, signed and dated 1637 (Bartsch 30). The story of Hagar is found in the Genesis, chapters 16 and 21. Genesis 16:2-3 states that Hagar was an Egyptian servant belonging to Sarah, who, being barren, gave Hagar to her husband Abraham ""to be his wife"", so that he might still have children. She gave birth to a son, Ishmael. Fourteen years later, God granted Sarah a child, named Isaac. According to Genesis, God commanded Abraham to obey Sarah's wishes and expel Hagar and Ishmael into the wilderness alone. Rising early in the morning, therefore, Abraham took bread and a container of water and sent his former consort, Hagar, and his son, Ishmael, away. The Biblical text suggests that Ishmael was about 13 when Sarah gave birth to Isaac and banished Hagar and her son. The boy looks closer to this age than the servant the Shunammite woman called for in the Book of Kings. Further the water bottle is slung over the saddle recalls the passage in Genesis 21, 14 ‘So Abraham rose early in the morning, and took bread and a skin of water, and gave it to Hagar...' X-rays have demonstrated that the painting has been greatly repainted in the landscape and background, that the arch is a later addition, and that it may originally have depicted a day scene, later transformed into the curious spot-lit night seen now visible. A day scene would more closely correspond to the account in Genesis 21 which begins: ‘Abraham rose early in the morning…’ The presence of the quiver of arrows at the boy's hip fits with the story of Ishmael who 'grew up; he lived in the wilderness, and became an expert with the bow’ (Genesis 21, 20). Further, the presence of the donkey may be an allusion to the prophetic words of the Lord: ‘He [Ishmael] shall be a wild ass of a man, his hand against every man and every man's hand against him; and he shall dwell over against all his kinsmen.’ (Genesis 16, 12). The interaction between the boy and the ass may allude to this, just as the quiver at his side may refer to his mastery of the bow.",victoria-and-albert-museum-london-uk,o; i; l; n,Height: 39 cm (estimate); Width: 53.2 cm (estimate); Height: 61 cm (frame); Width: 75 cm (frame),https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O81365/,TRUE,FALSE

Nine years later, he created the first of five painted versions of The Sick Child , all representing Sophie just prior to her death. Munch later described the process of painting these works as a form of technical and personal catharsis. Due to the great success of the paintings and his own psychological preoccupations, in 1894–96 Munch made three prints based on the motif, of which The Sick Child I was the last. In 1896 the artist traveled to Paris to experiment with new print-making processes and work with respected printers such as Auguste Clot, hoping to gain the commercial success that had previously eluded him in the French capital. There he made this, his first color lithograph, which features Sophie’s head silhouetted against a pillow. Munch printed the lithograph with several different stones and a variety of color combinations: he made the keystone either black or red and added up to four other color stones in combinations of blue, gray, red, yellow, reddish brown, and purple-blue.

Although he was known for the obscure imagery and difficult syntax of his verse, Mallarmé enjoyed the friendship of other modern thinkers, in particular, Impressionist and Post-Impressionist artists such as Édouard Manet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Odilon Redon, Edgar Degas, Paul Gauguin, and James McNeill Whistler. Despite the fact that much of his poetry is unabashedly extreme and difficult to decipher, artists continue, to this day, to turn to his evocative verse for inspiration. Edvard Munch met Mallarmé during a trip to Paris in 1896–97, and he became a regular guest at Mallarmé’s Tuesday night soirees, where he mingled with other visionaries of the day such as August Strindberg and Vincent van Gogh. In this portrait, Munch depicted the poet as a disembodied head, floating almost mystically. The use of green ink recalls the faded green accouterments of Mallarmé’s study. Of this portrait Munch said, “I drew him in half-shadow which matched his character.” Though it is not known whether this was a commissioned portrait, it might have been intended for the frontispiece of an edition of the complete works of Mallarmé, published in 1897. The project ultimately failed because Munch worked too slowly. Regardless of that disappointment, Mallarmé was pleased with the final print and described it as a “gripping portrait, which gives me an intimate sense of myself.”",art-institute-of-chicago-us,Transfer lithograph with crayon and scraping in green on cream Japanese paper,Image: 37.3 × 29.2 cm (14 11/16 × 11 1/2 in.); Sheet: 63.7 × 43.8 cm (25 1/8 × 17 1/4 in.),https://www.artic.edu/artworks/13521,FALSE,FALSE

Here Munch tried to capture the emotions called forth by the night rather than to record its picturesque qualities. The color blue conveys the mysticism and melancholy of the landscape, which seems full of premonitions. An abstract mound at the right represents a clump of trees; a white fence runs diagonally in front. The vaguely defined shape on the fence may be a shadow of two lovers, a recurring theme in Munch's work. He used an undulating line to depict the shoreline that continues into the trees at the right. Stars reflect in the water, and a flash of light in the trees shines brightly. Varying thicknesses of blue and green paint are blended together to form the impression of a night sky.

Boucher seldom ventured from major paintings and decorative ensembles to do finished, independent works on paper. Nor did he pursue portraiture, apart from his depictions of royal patrons and members of his family. This engaging and fresh portrait of a boy, perhaps a studio apprentice, may well be one of Boucher’s first, and finest, forays into pastel drawing. With this adaptable and newly fashioned medium, Rococo artists were able to imbue their images with a spirited directness and sense of life. Here Boucher captured the dimple-cheeked lad just as he seems to turn, lips parted as if to speak. The youth’s attentive gaze, tousled hair, and delicately elegant city clothes herald the artist’s suave later manner as court painter. The same young model, again holding a carrot, appears in at least two paintings of pastoral subjects by Boucher.",art-institute-of-chicago-us,Pastel on buff laid paper,30.8 × 24.3 cm (12 3/16 × 9 5/8 in.),https://www.artic.edu/artworks/35692,FALSE,FALSE

The god visited her only at night so she would not learn his divine identity. One night Psyche was unable to restrain her curiosity and glimpsed Cupid’s face. She was banished for her disobedience but eventually recovered Cupid’s trust and love.

To anchor his lush foliage of energetic chalk strokes, he built a strong underpinning of a winding road and solid buildings and filled the scene with props and details. The drawing is probably his only landscape on vellum. Boucher may have made this drawing, along with *Reclining Guitar Player,* for his first tapestry series for the Beauvais Tapestry Manufactory. He designed this series, *Les fêtes italiennes,* between 1734 and 1746, and Beauvais produced and sold more copies of this tapestry series than any other.

The gathers of fabric on which he leans, the wrinkled folds of his coat, and the outstretched length of his legs all create interest and draw the viewer's eyes around the figure and into the composition. François Boucher used a technique known as *aux trois crayons*, in red, black, and white chalks, which he and his contemporaries made popular in France in the 1700s. As a middle tone, he adopted the blue paper favored by Venetian artists. A favorite painter at the French court, Boucher designed tapestries for the royal factories, Beauvais and Gobelins.

Intended to be framed and hung like a painting, *Venus and Cupid* typifies François Boucher's works both in its unselfconsciously erotic female nude and in its sensual use of the chalk medium. Until the 1700s, few artists had actively cultivated the powdery, floating qualities of chalks. Here the green pastel in the vegetation and the white chalk above it billow around Venus like a veil of smoke, complementing the soft, yielding fleshy bodies that Boucher created with a thick application of white chalk.

Another youth offers a shell full of fresh water to a dainty maiden in a diaphanous gown of purple-gold and red satin. These amorous couples, accompanied by young children frolicking with goats, appear in an idyllic setting of lush, green, leafy trees under a pale blue sky with gray-pink clouds. By blending sensuality, covert eroticism, and refinement, pastoral paintings such as these brought the world of aristocratic society and amorous games to the countryside. The pastoral genre in which François Boucher excelled delighted his patrons, answering the contemporary nostalgia for nature and excluding coarse reality. *The Fountain of Love*, dated 1748, originally served as a finished cartoon for a tapestry, one of a series of six known as the *Noble Pastorales*; another one of this series and this painting’s pendant, [*The Bird Catchers Coast*](http://www.getty.edu/art/collection/objects/590/francois-boucher-the-bird-catchers-french-1748/), is also in the J.

Putti and doves attend Venus, the goddess of love, as she lounges amid a luxurious heap of drapery, while an elaborately decorative sky occupies the upper half of the painting. The artist used a pastel palette of blues, pinks, mauves, and peach tones and loose, rapid brushstrokes more characteristic of his tapestry designs than of his finished oil paintings. In 1768, Jean-François Bergeret de Frouville commissioned a set of six mythological subjects for his house in Paris.

In the 1700s, small birds played an important symbolic role in courtship ritual: the gift of a caged bird from a man to a woman signified her capture of his heart. Posed in front of the ruins of the Temple of Vesta, young women dressed in exquisite finery play with small birds; some tether them with strings while others daintily hold them on their fingers. *The Bird Catchers* and its pendant, [*The Fountain of Love*](http://www.getty.edu/art/collection/objects/589/francois-boucher-the-fountain-of-love-french-1748/), were finished cartoons or models for a series of tapestries known as the *Noble Pastorales*.

Here, François Boucher used light, pastel colors and the broad, rapid brushstrokes found in his tapestry designs. The sky is blue tinged with pink, and there is a suggestion of dawn awakening as light appears on the horizon. In contrast to Aurora's ethereality, Cephalus and his sleeping dog are bound to the earth; Boucher's choice of colors for these two figures—greens, reds, browns, and blues—accentuate this fact.

In the foreground, a man repairs barrels while a mother and child rest in the straw by his side. As the sun streams in through the open doorway and down through the loft at the rear of the building, long fingers of light create patterns on the dark floor. The backlighting gives the scene an added sense of serenity, while throwing the figures at the front into deeper shadow. On a trip to Holland from around 1763 to 1766, Boucher studied Dutch landscape and genre scenes from the 1600s. Influenced by Dutch depictions of idyllic countrysides and interiors, the French artist produced a number of drawings of rural settings. Although most of these drawings have now been lost, scholars examining the records of Boucher's contemporary collectors have found various titles of similar works, such as *Farmer's House in the Form of a Barn and An Interior of a Barn with Three Farmers and a Woman.* This drawing therefore provides the only known record of Boucher's visit to the Netherlands.",the-getty-los-angeles-us,,Height: 26 cm; Width: 31.1 cm; Sort Number: 96 23 Numbers,https://www.getty.edu/art/collection/object/107RJS,TRUE,FALSE

One triton blows on his shell-trumpet while the other, wedged between his partner and a fantastical dolphin, empties water out of his horn. In both sea and sky, putti pay tribute to the goddess. Amid all this attention, Venus remains impassive, decidedly detached from the churning sea. François Boucher's immense popularity in eighteenth-century Europe was matched by his versatility; he created everything from cabinet paintings to tapestry and stage designs. But this drawing is one of only three known gouaches by Boucher. In this work, the painter loosely applied the media--his handling varying from the expressive, almost chaotic, energy of the sea to the delicate, linear touch applied to Venus and her female attendants. Given its large size and ambitious composition, the gouache was probably created as an independent work of art and not as a study for a painting.

The ladies are taking coffee for breakfast and seem to be attempting to feed the drink to their young children. Though coffee drinking had by this time been practiced in Europe for about a century, by 1700, the high prices and relative shortage of coffee grown in Mocha in the Yemen, prompted the Dutch East India Company to establish and exploit - along with the local regents - coffee plantations in areas such as Java, Indonesia and Jamaica and Barbados.

It was commissioned by Louise Ulrika, the Princess Royal of Prussia and future Queen of Sweden through the Swedish ambassador to the French Court, Count Carl Gustaf Tessin. It was one of a set of four planned to represent times of the day and represents morning. This subject was the only one of the four to be completed. Louise Ulrika specified that it should represent ‘a woman who has had her hair done, is still in her dressing gown, and amuses herself with looking at the trifles a milliner has spread out' (Dulau, p.92). As well as reflecting contemporary fashion, this image is also rich in interior detail in a muted Rococo style inspired by the work of contemporary designers like Jacques-François Blondel (1705-1774), who by the 1750s were reacting against the excesses of Rococo. The print shows a Marchande de Modes displaying her box of trimmings to her wealthy client. The Marchands de Modes catered for the top end of the retail market. These were marchands merciers or their wives, who developed their retail businesses to take advantage of the consumer boom that continued throughout the eighteenth century. They were not dress makers but retailers who sold trimmings for clothing such as silks, ribbons and lace. Increasingly as the eighteenth century progressed they advised their clients on the latest fashions and some embellished clients’ dresses with the trimmings that they selected. They displayed their creations in attractively appointed shops in the most fashionable shopping locations. Some Marchands de Modes focussed more on the retail side of the business, expanding their range to include exotic trinkets and other fashionable accessories such as snuffboxes and fans. By the middle of the eighteenth century shopping had become an established leisure activity and certain Marchands' shops such as 'Le Petit Dunkerque', which opened in 1767, became places for the most fashionable shoppers to be seen. European mercers played a role in the manfacture of textiles and the boom in consumerism in Europe that occurred from the later seventeenth and into the eighteenth century. Their purchasing practices took account of their consumers' desire for novelty and also attempted to encourage new uses of the textiles. For example, Indian cotton, long used for household linens, were by end of the seventeenth century now used in stockings, cuffs, shirts, headdresses, sleeves and petticoats as calicoes, chintzes and muslins. The mercers also encouraged increased consumption by prompting producers in Asia and at home to introduce seasonally changing patterns in their textiles. The major centres for trade with Asia from the end of the seventeenth and into the eighteenth centuries were the Southeast Indian coast and Bengal, and Canton in China. Textiles were also home-produced throughout Europe and silk was even grown in France where Lyons emerged as a silk production centre of international reputation.",victoria-and-albert-museum-london-uk,E; n; g; r,Height: 384 mm (sheet); Width: 272 mm (sheet); Height: 382 mm (platemark); Width: 269 mm (platemark),https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O860024/,TRUE,FALSE

These fantasies are known by the French term ' chinoiseries ' as these light and decorative subjects found particular favour in France in the eighteenth century. Chinoiseries soon became popular throughout Europe however, thanks to the lively trade in engravings of famous paintings or popular designs. The French court painter François Boucher's designs were much copied by decorative artists as they were available as engravings from the 1740s onwards. His pretty and fanciful subjects came to epitomise the fashionable French Rococo style. The Meissen factory in Saxony made several models, including this one,after a series of chinoiserie designs by Boucher entitled ' Les Délices de L'Enfance ' (The Delights of Childhood) inspired by engravings by J.J.

artwork_0003135,Portrait de François Boucher (1703-1770).,françois-boucher,painting,,https://collections.louvre.fr/media/cache/medium/20/87/04/00/AGO208704-000_PE.jpg,"Commentaire : Morceau de réception à l'Académie Royale de peinture le 28 janvier 1741 avec le portrait de Natoire, INV 30867. Il est à comparer avec le Portrait de Boucher d'Alexandre Roslin, maintenant conservé au Musée de Versailles. (G. Monnier, 1972). Neil Jeffares donne ce pastel à Gustaf Lundberg, portrait de François Boucher (1703-1770), peintre (Dictionary of pastellists before 1800, Londres, 2006, p. 359). Ce pastel et le portrait de Charles Natoire (INV 30867) ont été copiés à l'huile sur toile par Tadeusz Kuntz (1733-1793) en 1756 et sont conservés au château de Wilanów en Pologne (inv. 1725 pour Natoire, inv. 1846 pour Boucher). Le portrait de Natoire a été gravé (Stockholm, Nationalmuseum, collection de l'institut Tessin à Paris), copié à l'huile sur toile par Pierre Joseph Célestin François (1759-1851) avant 1793, date à laquelle l'œuvre est citée dans l'inventaire de la collection de l'Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture (A.N., F17 12674, no 640). Une copie au pastel signée « A. Bun » a été vendue à l'hôtel Drouot à Paris le 12 juillet 2016 (Me Le Floc'h, lot 91, repr. 0,635 × 0,495 m). Deux copies au pastel du portrait de Boucher sont répertoriées : l'une conservée au Nationalmuseum à Stockholm (inv. NMB 485.0,59 × 0,49 m), l'autre vendue à Poitiers le 2 mai 2012 (Me Segeron) puis à Chinon le 10 septembre 2014 (Me Herbelin, lot 114, repr.0,64 × 0,525 m). Formé à Stockholm par le peintre de cour David von Krafft, Gustaf Lundberg se perfectionna ensuite à Paris à partir de 1717 auprès de Pierre Jacques Cazes et des maîtres portraitistes Nicolas de Largillierre, Hyacinthe Rigaud et François de Troy. Le séjour parisien de Rosalba Carriera en 1720-1721 fut également déterminant pour sa pratique du pastel, le jeune Suédois regardant avec la plus grande attention les œuvres de la Vénitienne. La protection du diplomate Niclas Peter von Gedda, proche de Stanislas Leszczynski, lui permit de fixer les traits de Marie Leszczynska dès 1725 et de livrer un portrait de Louis XV inspiré d'un modèle de Jean-Baptiste Van Loo. Vers 1730, il travaillait à nouveau pour la famille royale (Salmon, 1997, p. 109-114). Ses œuvres ayant donné toute satisfaction, Lundberg put se prévaloir en 1740 du soutien du roi et de celui de Carl Gustaf Tessin, alors ambassadeur du roi de Suède à Paris, lorsqu'il décida de briguer la position de membre de l'Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture. Le règlement de la prestigieuse Compagnie en interdisait l'accès aux artistes de religion réformée. Aussi dut-il bénéficier de soutiens influents. Philibert Orry,le contrôleur général des Bâtiments, intervint auprès de l'Académie pour rappeler qu'elle avait déjà fait un précédent en recevant en 1717 le miniaturiste protestant Charles Boit. Le directeur Nicolas de Largillierre lui répondit que l'Assemblée s'était alors soumise aux ordres du Régent et que, « toujours soumise aux intentions de Sa Majesté », elle recevrait le sieur « Luneberk » avec plaisir si le contrôleur général jugeait à propos d'en obtenir l'ordre du roi. À l'occasion de la séance du 28 janvier 1741, les académiciens prenaient connaissance de la décision de Louis XV : « Informé du mérite du sieur Lundberg, son intention étoit qu'il fut reçu comme Etranger quoique de la Religion prétendue réformée, et cela sans tirer à conséquence » (cité par Ratouis de Limay, 1946, p. 123). Aussitôt, « toujours soumise aux intentions de Sa Majesté », l'Académie agréait Lundberg comme étranger. Un mois après, Largillierre lui demandait comme morceaux de réception les portraits de François Boucher et de Charles Natoire. Afin de respecter les délais d'exécution accordés,Lundberg peignit rapidement les deux oeuvres et les soumit lors de la séance du 23 février 1742. D'une indéniable habileté dans le dessin et dans le modelé, d'une réelle intensité d'expression et d'un coloris sobre, ainsi que le soulignait Ratouis de Limay, les pastels ouvraient à leur auteur la reconnaissance espérée. Exposé au Salon de 1743, le portrait de Boucher était favorablement accueilli. Avec son pendant décrivant l'épouse du peintre, il était cité par le Mercure de France (septembre 1743, p. 2043-2060) comme ayant suscité beaucoup d'éloges de la part du public. Dans les Observations sur les écrits modernes (XXXIV, Paris, 1743, p. 48), sans doute l'abbé Pierre François Guyot Desfontaines notait également que les portraits du pastelliste étaient d'une bonne touche et que l'on y remarquait principalement des tons agréables dans les mains et une couleur fraîche qui plaisait beaucoup. Tout ostentatoire à la fois dans son attitude d'artiste à la renommée désormais assurée, Boucher paraissait aussi, selon les mots d'André Michel (cité par Jean-Richard, 1971, p. 104), l'œil bien ouvert mais un peu battu et gardant l'empreinte des soirées de plaisir au moins autant que des journées de travail. D'un tempérament plus modeste, Natoire était figuré avec plus de simplicité, tenant un carton à dessins. Les deux pastels sont d'une technique presque picturale où la matière colorée semble posée en touches larges, épaisses et souples, chargées en eau et où les blancs ont en partie été peints à la gouache. Ils sont caractéristiques de cette douceur, de cette luminosité et de ce mélange subtil des tons qui marquent certaines des œuvres les plus psychologiques de la période parisienne (X. Salmon, 2018).

In Ballet at the Paris Opéra , the artist creatively joined the monotype technique, rarely used in his time, with the fragile medium of pastel. Described as “the powder of butterfly wings,” pastel was the perfect medium to illustrate the onstage metamorphosis of spindly young dancers into visions of beauty as perfect and short-lived as butterflies. This work, executed on one of the widest monotype plates ever used by the artist, bears Degas’s characteristically cropped forms and odd vantage points, which effectively convey the immediacy of the scene. The view is from the orchestra pit, with the necks of the double basses intruding into the dancers’ zone. The central dancer is in fifth position, en pointe , but the random placement of the corps de ballet, with the dancers’ free-flowing hair, suggests a rehearsal rather than a performance. The Paris Opéra was the official school of the first state-supported ballet, the Académie Royale de Danse, created in 1661.",art-institute-of-chicago-us,Pastel over monotype on cream laid paper,Plate: 35.2 × 70.6 cm (13 7/8 × 27 13/16 in.); Sheet: 35.9 × 71.9 cm (14 3/16 × 28 5/16 in.),https://www.artic.edu/artworks/61603,FALSE,TRUE

As a result of its unusual cropping and tilted perspective, it seems to capture an unedited glimpse of the interior of a small nineteenth-century millinery shop. The identity of the young woman in the painting remains unclear: she may be a shop girl or a customer. In an early version of the composition, the woman is clearly intended to be a customer; she wears a fashionable dress, though her hat—a prerequisite token of bourgeois culture—is absent. In the final painting, however, the woman appears with her mouth pursed, as if around a pin, and her hands gloved, possibly to protect the delicate fabric of the hat she holds. Degas seems to have deliberately left her role as a creator or consumer ambiguous. She is totally absorbed in her activity and, like most of the women in Degas’s paintings, seems unaware of being watched. The bonnets that are displayed on the table next to her like a still life present an analogy to the artist’s creative process: where they are unfinished, so too is the painting.",art-institute-of-chicago-us,Oil on canvas,100 × 110.7 cm (39 3/8 × 43 9/16 in.); Framed: 132.1 × 142.3 × 9.6 cm (52 × 56 × 3 3/4 in.),https://www.artic.edu/artworks/14572,TRUE,TRUE

This picture, undertaken around 1860, speaks to his ambition to realize canvases featuring scenes from the Bible, as well as ancient and more recent history. Degas took his subject from the life of Lycurgus, a legendary ninth-century b.c. Spartan lawgiver. Lycurgus’s social reforms included an unusual method of physical training in which adolescent girls competed on an equal footing with boys, exercising nude in public.

His portrait subjects were usually close friends and family members—especially those from the Italian side of his family in Florence and Naples, where he frequently visited. He most likely painted this double portrait in 1875 during a four-month stay in Naples. It depicts his orphaned ﬁrst cousin, Lucie, and their uncle Henri, in whose care the girl had recently been placed. In this painting, Degas showed two people, separated by many years in age, tentatively accepting the circumstances of their new relationship. Having recently lost his own father, the artist addressed subjects such as this with candor and sensitivity. Areas of thin paint and unresolved details suggest that the work was never completed. Nonetheless, the spare treatment of the background eff ectively emphasizes the ﬁ gures’ heads and upper bodies. Degas expressed their connection through the similar tilt of their heads and their black mourning clothes. At the same time, the edge of a French door in the background and the back of Henri’s chair divide the characters into separate sections of the canvas, creating a subtle allusion to their psychological discomfort. At once intimate and distant, casual and guarded, the portrait expresses the fragility and necessity of family ties, not only between the two people depicted but also with the third relative who painted them from the other side of the paper-laden table.",art-institute-of-chicago-us,Oil on canvas,99.8 × 119.9 cm (39 1/4 × 47 3/16 in.); Framed: 118.2 × 137.8 × 8.9 cm (46 1/2 × 54 1/4 × 3 1/2 in.),https://www.artic.edu/artworks/14574,TRUE,TRUE

However, periodically he explored the landscape genre, with a trip in 1869 to the Normandy Coast, for example, that resulted in a number of pastel landscapes. During the peak years of Impressionism-the 1870s and 1880s, when landscape reigned supreme among France's avant-garde-Degas was notoriously averse to the practice of open-air landscape painting. Yet in the 1890s, he produced several groups of landscapes, combining observation and invention in various ways. The artist's renewed interest was prompted by a trip he took he took through Burgundy in 1890 that inspired him to treat its landscape using the technique of monotype. A monotype is made by painting or drawing an image in greasy printer 's ink on a metal plate and then printing the plate onto a sheet of paper. Only one strong impression can usually be pulled from the plate; on occasion, a second, paler impression known as a monotype cognate can be pulled as well. Degas sometimes completed pastels over monotypes or monotype, cognates, as in Landscape with Smokestacks. He pioneered this technique in the 1870s. He began some of his monotypes on the spot, while others-possibly Landscape with Smokestacks -were recollections. Certainly, Degas's aim in such compositions was quite different from his colleague Claude Monet's preoccupation with changing atmospheric effects. While rooted in experience, Degas's landscapes of memory are brooding and mysterious.",art-institute-of-chicago-us,"Pastel, over monotype, on textured cream wove paper, edge-mounted on board",31.7 × 41.6 cm (12 1/2 × 16 7/16 in.),https://www.artic.edu/artworks/151507,FALSE,FALSE

First, on the printing plate, he manipulated diluted oil paint with cloth pads and coarse bristle brushes. Having transferred these textural effects to the paper, he added pastel over the monotype, lending definition to the leaves and branches of the trees. In November 1892, Degas’s monotype landscapes were the subject of an exhibition at the gallery of Paul Durand-Ruel. One critic heralded it as the “event of the season.” The show included between 24 and 26 images of this kind; the art dealer purchased them all, at the considerable price of 1000 francs each.",art-institute-of-chicago-us,"Pastel, over color monotype, on off-white wove paper, laid down on cream card",Image: 25.3 × 34.5 cm (10 × 13 5/8 in.); Sheet: 27 × 35.9 cm (10 11/16 × 14 3/16 in.),https://www.artic.edu/artworks/185805,FALSE,FALSE

He wears casual clothes, including an open collar and broad brimmed hat. The informal, extreme close-up view of Degas's face and his impassive, almost sullen expression echo the unpretentiousness of his clothing. The small-scale, informal presentation and lightness of touch emphasize the intimacy of this image and the still-tentative character of the young artist. Around 1857, when he was twenty-three or twenty-four, Degas traveled to Italy, where he spent much of his time making copies after Renaissance masters. The period was one of self-education and he drew prolifically, writing in one of his notebooks, ""I must thoroughly realize I know nothing at all; it is the only way to get ahead.""

At these gatherings, Degas drew portraits of his friends and made studies for his own work. He quickly filled this sketchbook with drawings that show his preoccupation with a variety of theatrical themes, including the *café-concert* and the ballet. When he completed the sketchbook, Degas presented it to his friend, who shared his passion for theater and music. Halévy later added inscriptions to many of the pages--a useful addition for scholars, as they distinguish Degas's contributions from those by other friends who occasionally drew in the book. Halévy inscribed the date 1877 and the words *Croquis de Degas* (Degas's Sketchbook) on the book's cover. During his lifetime, Degas filled thirty-eight sketchbooks, using them for a variety of purposes: recording the appearance of a work of art he admired or a person he observed, visualizing a fictional scene he had read, or experimenting with a new idea.

Three vertical lines representing the doorframe and open door effectively frame the simple, evocative scene. Scholars believe the drawing is based on a scene from the novel *La Fille Elisa* (The Girl Elisa), which tells the story of a girl who became a prostitute. The simple realities of everyday life captured the artist's interest, revealing his gift for expression in every line.

On this crowded sheet, one dancer practices at the bar in the upper left with her back toward the viewer, while two others with legs extended lean over on the right. It was the studied position of each girl's legs that fascinated the artist; he often did not even bother to finish the top half of the body.

Using quick, even careless strokes, Degas outlined the figures with abrupt lines as if he was impatient to record each woman's posture or hand movement in the most emphatic terms without sacrificing swiftness or spontaneity.

The glowing globes behind the head of Mademoiselle Dumay emphasize the whiteness of her face and her dark hair.

His comment above makes clear that he was aware of this response to his work. An early practitioner of Realism, Degas captured women engaged in mundane tasks--laundresses ironing, prostitutes waiting for clients, and, most frequently, women bathing. The intimate subject of this painting, a woman bathing in a private interior, is one that invites voyeurism. Degas depicted the woman lying on a divan, while her maid dries or combs her hair. With her back pushed to the extreme foreground of the images, she seems to hold the viewer at bay. Bracing herself with her left arm, the woman uncomfortably raises her left leg against the edge of the bathtub. Such unnatural poses have perplexed critics of Degas's time, as they do viewers today. Some see these poses as an attempt to depict human movement not in idealized forms, but in ordinary, private behavior. Others see such representations of women as misogynistic.",the-getty-los-angeles-us,"Oil Paint (Paint), Canvas (Textile Material)",Height: 65.72 cm; Width: 82.23 cm; Depth: 5.71 cm; Height: 86.68 cm,https://www.getty.edu/art/collection/object/108H4X,TRUE,FALSE

In these venues, he sought out unusual perspectives and extremes of movement: the subject of this drawing offered him both. The Cirque Fernando opened its doors in 1875 in the Pigalle neighborhood, a hotspot for Parisian nightlife and progressive art. Degas lived nearby, as did Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, and Georges Seurat, all of whom painted pictures of the Cirque Fernando. It was there that Degas watched a famous aerialist known as “Miss La La” in January 1879. Born Olga Brown in 1858 in what is today Poland, this biracial performer toured France and England under a variety of stage names (the Venus of the Tropics, the African Princess) calculated to appeal to European notions of “exotic” beauty. She was a virtuoso performer. Her act included various feats of strength and agility, but its climax involved being hoisted high in the air by means of a pulley, a rope, and a specially fitted dental device. This is the feat Degas portrayed here. He was so captivated by Miss La La’s performance that he returned night after night to sketch her, producing a series of life studies that culminated in an [oil painting](https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/hilaire-germain-edgar-degas-miss-la-la-at-the-cirque-fernando), shown at the Fourth Impressionist Exhibition later that year. Each of the studies is inscribed with the date when Degas made it (in this case, January 21, 1879), probably working in black pastel from his seat at the circus and then adding other colors once back in his studio.

Described by the great Degas specialist Jean Sutherland Boggs as “a poignant blend of eroticism and anguish,” this pose sums up all that is most appealing—and disquieting—in the artist’s treatment of the female nude. The same figure is repeated quite precisely in several oil paintings and at least one pastel; it was likely modeled on a photograph today in the Getty collection ([84.XM.495.2][1]). Despite the existence of various more “finished” versions of this subject, however, Degas plainly considered the proposed sheet a worthy representation of his talents, selecting it from hundreds of drawings in his studio to sign and published with just nineteen others in the 1897 book Degas: Vingt Dessins.

Her pose, at once graceful and tortuous, lends this scene a frisson, encouraging us to believe we have surprised this woman in a private moment. Unseen windows bathe her back in light, conjured with electric streaks and scribbles of color, while her face, lost in shadow, seems to gaze into the opalescent depths of the tub beside her. Like the other items of furniture depicted, this tub at once corroborates and undermines the fiction of a moment surprised, intersecting abruptly with a folding screen and disappearing from view. Along with the expanse of tufted carpet, the overstuffed canapé, and the cascade of drapery at left, these objects form a dreamy indoor landscape—less the ordinary terrain of a domestic interior than an intimate corner of Degas’s studio. Dated to 1882-1885 by Paul-André Lemoisne in volumne II of his 1946-1948 catalogue raisonné of Degas’s work, this pastel was likely made at a somewhat later moment, 1886 or after, when, having achieved financial independence, Degas had all but ceased to exhibit, retreating into the private world of his studio to produce increasingly bold, experimental work: wax and wire sculptures, oil paintings covered with fingerprints, pastels scratched out in vibrating, anti-naturalistic colors. The influence of a much younger artist, Paul Gauguin, was key to Degas’s evolution in this period: we may see his mark in the dazzling, dissonant hues of this pastel, which already predicts the thickets of pattern and color found in the work of Gauguin’s followers, the Nabis Bonnard and Vuillard, at the turn of the century. Like so many ambitious nudes of Degas’s later career, this work was never exhibited during his lifetime. He made numerous drawings and prints depicting models in essentially the same pose. Although, by the later 1880s, the artist’s ceaseless explorations of a single form or attitude could no longer be neatly sorted into the categories of “preparatory studies” and “finished works,” this particular series seems to have culminated in the present pastel; no other portrayal of this subject matches its density of touch and chromatic power.",the-getty-los-angeles-us,,Height: 72 cm; Width: 58 cm; Sort Number: 2017 75 1 Numbers,https://www.getty.edu/art/collection/object/109NER,TRUE,FALSE

The primary figure stands on one foot, with arms spread wide and her free leg extended in a battement à la seconde. She wears a muslin tutu and a look of concentration. Her counterpart, depicted horizontally in the lower portion of the sheet, turns downwards and inwards, apparently adjusting her bodice or sash. Strokes of white chalk indicate light streaming in from an unseen source behind the first dancer and before the second; two inscriptions near the bottom edge of the sheet read “très reflété”: a note from the artist to himself indicating strong reflected light. Degas used brilliant green, pink, and blue papers to work out individual figures for several of his ballet paintings from the early 1870s, tracing the contours and shadows in black chalk or thinned oil paint, using the colored paper to fill in the middle tones, and adding a few touches of white to suggest the reflective surfaces of satin and skin. The principal figure on this sheet is squared for transfer; both she and her companion appear in a painting known as [*The Rehearsal*][1], today in the Harvard Art Museums: there the dancing girl wears a crown of pale blue flowers and appears to the left of center, while the girl turned away figures in the background, her head apparently bowed in conference with another dancer.

He completed his artistic training with a three-year journey in Italy and specialised in contemporary subjects upon his return to France. His work is characterised by a wide range of media (drawings, prints, pastels, paintings and sculptures) and shares many components with the Realist and Impressionist movement even though he remained quite independent. At the end of his life he was regarded as a major artistic figure. This painting is a fine example of Degas' opera scenes. It depicts the final act of the Romantic opera Robert le Diable when deceased nuns come back to life and execute some bacchanal dance. The scene is depicted from behind the orchestra and the first rows of spectators among whom can be recognised some friends of the artist. This compositional idea is quite typical of Degas and is recurring in several stage representations. Although Degas was close to some Impressionist painters, he rather defined his work as realist.",victoria-and-albert-museum-london-uk,o; i; l; n,Height: 76.6 cm (estimate); Width: 81.3 cm (estimate); Height: 115 cm (framed); Width: 121 cm (framed); Depth: 15 cm (framed); Height: 750 mm (stretcher),https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O17815/,TRUE,FALSE

He worked wet-into-wet for her dress, applying wet pigment onto an already wet surface before it had time to dry, which allowed the marks to bleed and blend into one another.

Seen as part of a European imperialist campaign, Maximilian’s rule was considered illegitimate by those who opposed the French occupation of Mexico. This work interprets the young ruler’s execution in Querétero, Mexico, on June 19, 1867, alongside generals Miguel Miramón (left) and Tomás Mejía (right). Édouard Manet’s composition was inspired by not only history painting and the iconography of Francisco de Goya but also contemporary journalism and the budding field of newspaper photography. One controversial aspect of this print is the presence of French troops in the firing squad rather than those of the Mexican Republic.

Manet’s depiction of a prostitute’s body in a contemporary setting was a radical rejection of the idealized beauty of the traditional female nude.

The holiday, called the *Fête de la Paix* (Celebration of Peace), also marked France's recovery from the disastrous Franco-Prussian War of 1870-1871 and the bloody, divisive Paris Commune that followed. From his second-floor window, Édouard Manet captured the holiday afternoon with his most precise, staccato brushwork in a patriotic harmony of the reds, whites, and blues of the French flag that waves from the new buildings' windows. The urban street was a principal subject of Impressionist and Modernist painting; many artists aimed to show not only the transformation and growth of the Industrial Age but how it also affected society. Manet's eyes saw both elegant passengers in hansom cabs and, in the foreground, a worker carrying a ladder. The hunched amputee on crutches, perhaps a war veteran or beggar, passes by fenced-in debris left from the construction of a new train track. Manet's sensitivity to the associated costs and sacrifices tempered his optimistic view of national pride and newfound prosperity.",the-getty-los-angeles-us,"Oil Paint (Paint), Canvas (Textile Material)",Height: 65.41 cm; Width: 80.01 cm; Depth: 11.43 cm; Height: 96.52 cm,https://www.getty.edu/art/collection/object/103RJM,TRUE,FALSE

Madame Brunet, the wife of a friend, rejected the painting on account of its perceived ugliness, however, and the artist retained it in his studio. He eventually cut off the bottom portion of the canvas, reducing it to a three-quarter-length portrait, and displayed it in his one-man exhibition in Paris in 1867—a show of independence opposite the World's Fair, where more polished examples of society portraiture, like James Tissot's [*Portrait of the Marquise de Miramon*]( https://www.getty.edu/art/collection/objects/239595/jacques-joseph-tissot-portrait-of-the-marquise-de-miramon-nee-therese-feuillant-french-1866/) (also in the Getty's collection), could be seen.",the-getty-los-angeles-us,"Oil Paint (Paint), Canvas (Textile Material)",Height: 132.4 cm; Width: 100.01 cm; Depth: 6.99 cm; Height: 153.67 cm,https://www.getty.edu/art/collection/object/109HJK,TRUE,FALSE

Here he depicted the animal painter Julien de la Rochenoire, an old friend who had likely dropped by Manet's studio. Dashing strokes of salmon and black animate the sitter's bewhiskered face, while the swirling background wallpaper evokes his psychological energy.

She looks straight ahead, a picture of poise and detachment even as she seems fully aware of the viewer's admiring gaze. Representing aspiring Parisian actress Jeanne Demarsy as the embodiment of Spring, this portrait debuted at the last major public exhibition of Manet's life, the Paris Salon of 1882. For more than two decades, Manet's paintings were rejected by the Salon or met with controversy; *Spring* was the most unalloyed success of the artist's Salon career, a career that ended tragically a year later when Manet died of causes related to syphilis. Appealing to critics primarily on account of Jeanne's charm, *Spring* also showcased Manet's mastery of his medium. The painting exhibits a marvelous range of brushwork, from the thin, delicate floral touches on the dress to the smooth handling of Jeanne's face and the broad, sketch-like strokes of the backdrop. The painting's sensual handling and bright, vibrant palette evoke the pleasures of the season it celebrates. When composing *Spring*, Manet had in view both the latest fashion trends and old artistic traditions. An avid connoisseur of feminine *couture*, he pieced together Jeanne's ensemble himself by scouring dressmakers' and milliners' shops. Posing his model in the studio, however, he referred to portrait conventions of the early Italian Renaissance, presenting her half-length, in profile, and against a mass of greenery. More than just an ephemeral ""fashion-plate,"" Manet's archetypal *Spring* was conceived as a picture for the ages, summarizing his modern epoch through the figure of a beautiful *Parisienne*.",the-getty-los-angeles-us,"Oil Paint (Paint), Canvas (Textile Material)",Height: 74 cm; Width: 51.5 cm; Depth: 9.21 cm; Height: 98.74 cm,https://www.getty.edu/art/collection/object/103QTZ,TRUE,FALSE

The snail perched on a leaf offers a laconic metaphor for the artist's situation in the summer of 1880, when he found himself more or less trapped in his Bellevue garden by a paralyzed leg that slowed his movements to a snail's pace. A horizontal crease through the middle of this sheet confirms that it was folded to fit in an envelope and sent (""snail mail"") to an unnamed female friend. Although the identity of the letter's fair recipient remains uncertain, Manet's instruction not to “forget the ream of English paper"" is clear enough. His new interest in watercolor necessitated a continuous supply of paper, often brought by visitors from Paris. For the artist and his contemporaries, watercolor was a quintessentially English medium; he used an English-made watercolor set, and many of his illustrated letters—including this one—bear English watermarks.",the-getty-los-angeles-us,,Height: 15.8 cm; Width: 11.7 cm; Sort Number: 2019 7 Numbers,https://www.getty.edu/art/collection/object/109NVR,TRUE,FALSE

Wishing to imbue his art with a sense of primitivism, he sought refuge in a country he thought untouched by modern practices. Gauguin found the inspiration he was looking for in Colonial French Tahiti, where he made this life-size drawing of a rather defiant looking teenage girl. In the drawing, he boldly articulated her head, face, and neck, while indicating her shoulders and collar with lighter lines. But the girl's Western dress suggests that Tahiti was not the exotic land Gauguin had imagined: missionaries had destroyed its pre-European culture. Using flat, decorative forms, Gauguin presented Tahitian women as mysterious, unknowable creatures.",the-getty-los-angeles-us,,Height: 41.91 cm; Width: 31.12 cm; Sort Number: 2001 57 Numbers,https://www.getty.edu/art/collection/object/108HGF,TRUE,FALSE

I have at this moment a series of experimental drawings that I'm fairly pleased with. I'm sending you a small specimen; it's like an impression and yet it isn't. Thick ink replaces pencil, that's all... > >--Paul Gauguin Near the end of his life in isolated French Polynesia, Gauguin invented his own technique to produce this unique, double-sided image. Both sides depict a young Tahitian woman as Eve in the Garden of Eden, surrounded by the Devil as a snake, a dark figure on horseback, and a fallen Adam. One side of the drawing consists of fine blue and black lines. Those markings are not only flipped or mirrored on the other side, but appear thicker and darker amid murky patches of black and ocher ink. This more colorful and detailed side was probably what Gauguin intended viewers to see. On its surface, Gauguin's experimental drawing looks primitive and casually made. However, its rough appearance belies a very sophisticated work, with nuanced mark-making and carefully aligned applications of color. The closest analogy to Gauguin's process might be the act of writing or drawing on carbon paper, which transfers marks to underlying pages. Gauguin coated a piece of paper with printer's ink. He placed another sheet of paper--what was to become this drawing--on top of it and drew the initial composition with black pencil. Then he blocked-in shading with ocher ink. Third, he strengthened the outlines with blue crayon. The pressure applied by the drawing instruments transferred ink to the underside of the sketched paper. For these successive ""printings,"" Gauguin had to change out the original sheet of inked paper and allow the drawing to dry, at least partially, between passes of ink. Last, he took a brush dipped in solvent and blended some areas of the drawing, most notably behind the figure of Eve. Gauguin's long-term obsession with the biblical story of ""the fall of man"" enabled him to explore dual themes such as good and evil in a single work. As with many of his images, the way that Gauguin used symbols--their context and juxtaposition--complicate interpretation. For example, although Eve gazes directly at the viewer, it is difficult to tell whether her expression is confident or baleful. Her awkward gestures, one hand holding a cloth to her genitals and the other against her cheek, perhaps indicate shameful awareness of her sinful actions. This particular Eve and the head of a hooded figure behind her originate from a drawing Gauguin made at least eight years earlier. He repeatedly incorporated these exact motifs into subsequent paintings and woodcuts. In this case also, the horse behind Eve may be inspired by a frieze design from the Parthenon, which Gauguin had in his collection of source materials brought from Europe. The hooded rider incorporates some of Gauguin's own features, and may also symbolize Death.",the-getty-los-angeles-us,,Height: 64.2 cm; Width: 48.9 cm; Sort Number: 2007 33 Numbers,https://www.getty.edu/art/collection/object/109B5V,TRUE,FALSE

Real events, from Tahitian King Pomare V's death soon after Gauguin's arrival, to the artist having witnessed a public execution by guillotine several years earlier, likely influenced its dark subject matter. Gauguin added the Tahitian words ""Arii"" and ""Matamoe"" in the canvas' upper left. The first means ""noble;"" the second, ""sleeping eyes,"" a phrase that implies ""death."" The notion of a human head ritually displayed in an ornate interior suggests the formality of a ruler lying in state, supported by the presence of sorrowful figures in the background. However, this scene doesn't correspond to actual accounts of Pomare V's funeral because the body wasn't decapitated. Gauguin was just as apt to fantasize about life in Polynesia as he was to document it. Bright reds, yellows, and pinks are juxtaposed with muted browns and purples to evoke a tropical sensibility. The rough, burlap-like canvas also hints at an exotic ""primitivism."" In his collage-illustrated book *Noa Noa*--which he began after his first trip to Tahiti--he included a copy of this painting and a comment that he thought of Pomare's death as a metaphor for the loss of native culture due to European colonization. Symbolist artists, including Gauguin, had a predilection for images of decapitated heads and any associated figures, such as Orpheus and John the Baptist. But in a more general sense, Gauguin also freely mixed Eastern and Western imagery. His obsession with the theme of death, which appears throughout his Tahitian paintings, is less a reference to spiritual beliefs or to what he saw around him than perhaps more significantly, how he viewed himself. Gauguin thought of himself as a martyr victimized by modern society, which compelled him to escape to a ""primitive"" culture.",the-getty-los-angeles-us,,Height: 45.09 cm; Width: 74.3 cm; Depth: 5.4 cm; Height: 66.68 cm,https://www.getty.edu/art/collection/object/109CGS,TRUE,FALSE

Traditionally, portraits of men were somber, but Renoir combined decorativeness with fidelity to his sitter's appearance. Facial hair was regarded as a powerful indicator of male sexuality, and Renoir shows Cahen d'Anvers's curled mustache echoing the wallpaper's curves, his ruffled red hair referring to the potted plant's feathery leaves. Cahen d'Anvers's authority and status are suggested through his alert, commanding gaze and details such as his elaborate cigarette holder and cravat. Renoir hoped that success in portraiture would lead to success in the wider potential market attracted by the Salon. Twenty years into his career, he had become so disenchanted with Impressionism that he called the movement a ""blind alley."" He modified his style, combining the loose, painterly effects of early works such as *La Promenade* with Renaissance painting's firm contours and weighty forms. He began receiving portrait commissions, often from wealthy Jewish patrons. Only a year after making this portrait, however, his uncertainty about achieving his aims through portraiture and his increasing anti-Semitism meant that portraiture no longer appeared so promising to him.",the-getty-los-angeles-us,"Oil Paint (Paint), Canvas (Textile Material)",Height: 80.01 cm; Width: 63.82 cm; Depth: 9.84 cm; Height: 113.03 cm,https://www.getty.edu/art/collection/object/103QRV,TRUE,FALSE

Renoir had spent the previous summer painting outdoors with Claude Monet, who encouraged him to move toward a lighter, more luminous palette and to indulge his penchant for luscious, feathery brushwork. Here Renoir retained something of Gustave Courbet's green-and-brown palette while choosing his subject from the sensual, lighthearted garden jaunts of eighteenth-century painters such as Jean-Antoine Watteau and Jean-Honoré Fragonard, whose works he had studied in the Louvre. Unlike the images of seduction created by his predecessors, Renoir's is a fleeting moment caught by chance--middle-class Parisians immersed in nature, possibly a local park, not set before a studio backdrop. The dappled light filtering through the foliage would become a trademark of Renoir's finest Impressionist works of the 1870s and 1880s. He used a thin, oily paint mix, his glazes here floating into each other to create depth.",the-getty-los-angeles-us,"Oil Paint (Paint), Canvas (Textile Material)",Height: 81.28 cm; Width: 64.8 cm; Depth: 8.89 cm; Height: 110.17 cm,https://www.getty.edu/art/collection/object/103RJJ,TRUE,FALSE

Ce grand dessin de 1908 est, parmi les multiples études de ce thème que Renoir développe bien souvent entre 1908 et 1916 environ, l'un des plus proches de l'archétype du sujet établi par Raphaël et dont la gravure de Marcantonio Raimondi (Bartsch illustré, 1978, vol. 26, p. 242, n° 245) a assuré le succès.

artwork_0004193,"Upraised Right Hand, with Palm Facing Outward: Study for Saint Peter",raphael,painting,1518/20,"https://www.artic.edu/iiif/2/f00f93d0-ed84-aaea-d93a-b3417e97dd62/full/843,/0/default.jpg","The traditional attribution for Raphael of this long overlooked and hitherto unpublished drawing was recently upheld by Konrad Oberhuber, Paul Joannides, and Nicholas Turner (in conversation, 1995/96) all of whom agreed that it should be dated 1518/20, towards the very end of Raphael’s career. In the image represented, as well as its medium, technique and style, the drawing relates to Raphael’s most important commissions from this period; the Transfiguration altarpiece, now in the Pinacoteca Vaticana (Dussler 1971, pp. 52-55, pl. 111), which he completed shortly before his death on April 6, 1520; and the decoration of the walls of the Sala di Costantino, the largest of the papal suite of rooms in the Vatican (Dussler, pp. 86-88, pls. 143-44; Quednau 1979). With the possible exception of two allegorical figures in oil, this project, which was underway by late 1519, was largely executed by Raphael’s assistants under the direction of Giulio Romano, and completed in 1524. Although the Sala’s general decorative scheme was devised by Raphel, there are still questions concerning the extent of his responsibility for the design of individual components (Oberhuber/Fischel 1972, pp. 184-204). The gesture itself, of the upraised right arm and hand with palm facing outward, is reminiscent of that of Christ in the Transfiguration , as conveyed in two modelli , possibly by Giovanni Francesco Penni, in the Louvre (3954; Cordellier/Py 1992, pp. 533-34, no. 905, repr.) and the Albertina (193; Birke/Kertész 1992-, vol. 1, pp. 110-11, repr.), which preserve two abandoned designs for the Transfiguration . In both modelli , Christ's arm is dramatically bent and thereby foreshortened as in the Chicago drawing, whereas in the actual painting, the same arm is more fully extended within the picture plane. Although it is conceivable that Raphael would have executed a detail study for this important gesture even in the early planning stages, it is unlikely that the Chicago drawing represents this study. Despite morphological similarities between the classically proportioned fingers and thumb, and those of the hands of the two apostles in an auxiliary black chalk cartoon for the Transfiguration in the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford (P II 568; Joannides 1983, no. 437, pl. 38), the hard consistency of the black chalk in the Chicago drawing and the overall polished surface conflict stylistically with the softer chalk employed in the Ashmolean cartoon, and the resulting atmospheric, painterly effect produced by the merging of contours and smudged parallel hatching in that sheet. Moreover, the outlines of what appear to be a cowl or cope in the upper arm are not consonant with the unspecified, toga-like drapery arrangement given to Christ in both the modelli and the final painting. Although the Chicago drawing may have derived from an abandoned idea Raphael had for Christ’s right arm in the Transfiguration, it bears a much more precise relationship with the upraised right arm and hand of Saint Peter in the Sala di Costantino (Fig. 36; Quednau, pp. 181-204, pl. 33). Attended by the personifications of Ecclesia and Eternity, Saint Peter is one of eight early popes enthroned in niches, and flanking four narrative scenes from the history of Constantine, represented as feigned tapestries on each of the four walls. Peter is immediately identifiable by the pair of large keys he grasps in the his left hand, symbolizing Christ’s charge to him in Matthew 16:18-19. His right hand, with palm facing outward, is raised in a ceremonial gesture that at the time could have been interpreted as blessing or commanding (Quednau, pp. 182, 654-55 n. 615), but in either case would have reinforced the message of papal supremacy proclaimed throughout the room. In this particular case, the Biblical legitimacy of the pope’s role as successor to Peter, Christ’s vicar (then being undermined by Martin Luther), was underscored by the flanking figures of Ecclesia, who holds up a model of the church that Peter was to establish on earth, and Eternity, who symbolized the heavenly kingdom. Several key elements are held in common by the Chicago drawing and the relevant portion of the fresco of Saint Peter, which suggests that it served as a preparatory study for this detail. Beyond the similar gesture of the hand, and foreshortened arm, there is a clear connection between the cope worn by Peter, and the corresponding outline in the drawing, while the crumpled cuff in both fresco and drawing is virtually identical. In addition, the light in the drawing falls from the left, as it does in the fresco, which was located at the northern end of the east wall, receiving direct light from the nearest of the two windows on the north wall facing the courtyard of the Belvedere (for relevant photograph, see Oberhuber/Fischel 1972, fig. 203). While the general patterns of light and shadow created by Raphael in the drawing are maintained in the fresco, there are noteworthy differences in the specific treatment of the hand as painted by Giulio Romano. The fingers are more curved and have acquired a gnarled and swollen quality, but, more strikingly, the palm has been stretched disproportionately wide, and the fingers elongated, in keeping with Giulio’s exaggerated treatment of such morphological details in drawings for his earliest independent works, such as a black chalk study at Windsor Castle (0339) for a nude figure in the Martyrdom of Saint Stephen, of 1521/23 (New York 1987, no. 62 repr.). Here, the man’s upraised right hand, albeit not treated in as much detail, provides an instructive comparison, not only in the floppy, elongated fingers themselves, but in the relief-like treatment of the entire figure, and the lack of any underlying anatomical structure. Although there are no other detailed hand studies associated with the Sala di Costantino, the Chicago drawing compares well in its technique and style to two of the small group of figure studies accepted as being by Raphel: A study in the Uffizi (542 E.) for an advancing soldier in the Adlocutio of Constantine , the narrative scene to the right of Saint Peter (Oberhuber/Fischel 1972, p. 201. no. 484, pl. 84; Joannides 1983, p. 244, no. 444r, repr.), and a study in the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford (P II 569), for two soldiers struggling in the water in the right foreground of the Battle of the Milvian Bridge , on the south wall of the Sala di Costantino (Oberhuber/Fischel, p. 204, no. 487, pl. 86; Joannides, pp. 120-21, pl 44; New York 1987, no. 40 repr.). Like the Chicago drawing, these are executed with swift strokes of black chalk and patches of white heightening over a fine network of stylus lines, creating in each case an expressive form whose surface texture is modeled by the particular pattern of light and shadow dictated by its placement in the complex illusionistic scheme conceived by Raphael. As Paul Joannides has observed, the bodies of the submerged soldiers are intentionally rendered as smoother and more generalized than that of the advancing soldier, in part because “their slickness of surface emphasizes their wetness,” but also because the advancing soldier required more detail, given his placement on the east wall, which received brighter, less diffused light. Although the Chicago drawing shares this more detailed treatment of surface with the Uffizi soldier, its style is perceptibly harder, particularly in the areas of the lower palm and the wrist, where the short, black chalk strokes are not blurred and softened with stumping or white heightening, but seem to stitch a taut impenetrable fabric, which coolly reflects the passage of light and shadow. Such detailing of the surface of Peter’s hand, as specified in the preparatory study, would have been necessitated by the figure’s proximity to the raking light coming from the north window. Without diminishing the inherent organic vitality of the hand emerging from the sleeve, Raphael intentionally endowed both with a marble-like sheen in order to establish clearly for the executant the illusionistic role played by the sculptural form of the enthroned Peter. — Entry, Italian drawings before 1600 in the Art Institute of Chicago , 1997, p.205.",art-institute-of-chicago-us,"Black chalk, heightened with white chalk and lead white, partially oxidized, over stylus underdrawing, on cream laid paper",28.6 × 19.7 cm (11 5/16 × 7 13/16 in.),https://www.artic.edu/artworks/114932,FALSE,FALSE

Here, the print shows a sitting Sybil who is reading a book to a child holding a torch to illuminate the room.

In addition to Apollo and his muses, Raphael portrayed some of history’s most celebrated poets on the Greek mountain Parnassus.

Invented to emulate drawings with light and dark pigments on tinted paper, the printing technique uses multiple woodblocks to layer different tones of color. The Descent from the Cross is one of the earliest chiaroscuro woodcuts by Ugo da Carpi. This print credits Raphael with its design: it was inspired by one of Raphael's now-lost drawings for a scene of Deposition that he should have painted in Loggie Vaticane. In a sketch-like hilly landscape, Christ's dead body is taken down from the cross by four men, one of whom is removing the nail from his right palm. Below, the three Marys attend the fainted Virgin.

They illustrate passages from the Bible concerning the lives of Saint Peter and Saint Paul. None of them is smaller than ten feet high by thirteen feet wide. They belong to Her Majesty the Queen and have been on loan to this museum since 1865. The earliest print relating to the Raphael Cartoons dates from 1516, the year in which Raphael received final payment for the commission. It inaugurates an extraordinary case study in the history of printmaking, stretching over more than four hundred and fifty years and across a wide range of printmaking techniques. Simon Gribelin was the first printmaker to issue a complete set of prints of the Cartoons. When they came out in 1707 they carried a letterpress titlepage dedicating them to Queen Anne. Although they met with success it was nothing compared to that which greeted the set produced by Nicholas Dorigny in 1719. This frontispiece accompanied a reissue of the Gribelin set in 1719, by which time Queen Anne was dead and George I was on the throne. The tone of the lettering seems to be a slightly petulant response to Dorigny's set of prints, asserting Gribelin's prior claim to having engraved the Cartoons. Gribelin was born in France but came to England around 1680. He was the most important silver engraver in London at the beginning of the eighteenth century. This meant engraving on the surfaces of watches, tea caddies, salvers etc. He was also a printmaker. In the 1690s he published two prints after history paintings by Charles Le Brun, then in 1706 he engraved an altar dish with a scene of the Deposition based on a picture by Annibale Carracci. These may have led to the idea of engraving the Cartoons. The antiquarian George Vertue wrote in his notebooks ""in London about 1700, the state of Print Engraving on Copper was at a low ebb… til about 1707. Mr Griblins cartons in print from the pictures of Raphael were well received, and vast numbers of them [sold]."" As well as visual information each print delivers written information in the form of a caption in English and Latin giving the title, the biblical reference, the names of the artist and the engraver, and stating the location of the Cartoons. Horace Walpole, writing in 1763, said of these prints ""their success was very great having never been completely engraved before; but they were too small a volume, nor had Gribelin anything of greatness in his manner or capacity: His works have no merit than finicalness, and that not in perfection, can give them."" Dr. Johnson defined finicialness as ""superfluous nicety or foppery"". Each of the individual engravings shows the Cartoon in reverse while the view of the Cartoon gallery shows them the right way round. In March 1735 Gribelin's son was selling sets of his late father's prints of the Cartoons for 15 shillings. By 1753 they had dropped to half a guinea (ten shillings and sixpence) in the price list of the print-publisher John Bowles. The following year in the catalogue of the print-publisher Henry Overton II, they were listed under ""Cheap Sets of Prints"".",victoria-and-albert-museum-london-uk,e; n; g; r,Height: 22 cm (sheet); Width: 25.4 cm (sheet); Height: 18.6 cm (platemark); Width: 21.8 cm (platemark),https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O239656/,TRUE,FALSE

The tapestries were intended to hang in the Sistine Chapel in Rome, built by one of Leo's predecessors Pope Sixtus IV (reg. 1471-84). The Chapel was primarily intended for the use of the Pope and the body of clergy and Laity immediately surrounding him. The decoration of the chapel under Sixtus addressed the lives of Moses and Christ. The tapestries continued this theme, illustrating scenes from the lives of St. Peter and St. Paul who were seen as the founders of the Christian Church, and reinforcing the legitimity of the Pope's authority and power. The resulting tapestries had in addition woven borders showing scenes from Leo's life and from the lives of Saint Paul, also designed by Raphael: the cartoons for these have not survived. In this cartoon Christ tells Peter to cast his net into the water whereupon he and his fellow apostles make a miraculous catch. The story refers to Peter's role as ""fisher of men"", who converts others to Christianity.

Having been appointed Hofmaler in March 1751, he left Dresden the following September, eventually spending the next ten years in Italy and never returning to Dresden again. In Rome and Naples, Mengs produced classical and religious scenes. He also wrote some theoretical texts under the influence of Johann Joachim Winckelmann. This painting is a full-size copy of the famous fresco the School of Athens painted by Raphael in 1508 in the Vatican.

Originally on display in the long gallery of Northumberland House in London, which was destroyed in 1874, the painting was transferred to his new residence, 2 Grosvenor Place, before being given to the museum in 1926.",victoria-and-albert-museum-london-uk,o; i; l; n,Height: 4.25 m (estimate); Width: 8.4 m (estimate),https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O89799/,TRUE,FALSE

In a total output of three hundred and seventy seven prints, only fifteen, including his prints of the Cartoons, are so-called Baxterotypes. Printed in shades of brown, they simulate photographs and the name echoes the word daguerreotype, the earliest photographic process, announced in 1839. George Baxter's premonition that the depiction of works of art by means of prints made by human hand would soon be facing a challenge from the new photographic processes, was correct.

This print is in reverse of the cartoon. Nicholas Dorigny's prints were the subject of an editorial in the 'Spectator' on the 19th November 1711. ""These invaluable pieces are very justly in the Hands of the greatest and most pious sovereign in the World; and cannot be the frequent object of every one at their own leisure; but an engraver is to a painter, what a printer is to an author it is worthy Her Majesty's name, that she has encouraged that noble artist Monsieur Dorigny to publish these works of Raphael."" Writing in 1722 about the works of Raphael in Rome, Jonathan Richardson said ""That I should write upon what I never saw may appear strange to some; Such may please only to obeserve that My remarks are chiefly upon the way of thinking itself."" The engraver and antiquarian George Vertue had met and spoken with Dorigny. Vertue records that ""several gentlemen of note travelling to Rome there found Mr Dorigny who was then in the highest reputation for several engraved works after Raphael. These got him justly the reputation of the first engraver in Europe for which reason several Curious persons persuaded & engaged him to come to England to undertake those Famous Cartons at Hampton Court painted by Raphael...From his coming to England [in 1711] I may justly date the rise of the reputation of the engraving."" According to George Vertue, Dorigny acknowledged trying to imitate the great French engraver Gérard Audran when he was studying to improve his engraving style. The first proposal was that Dorigny engrave the Cartoons for the exclusive use of Queen Anne as presents for the nobility and visiting diplomats. Dorigny's price for the work of £4000-£5000 meant this idea was quashed and the prints were sold by subscription at four guineas a set. Dorigny was provided with limited royal patronage in the form of lodgings at Hampton Court, coals, and a bottle of wine a day. The lettering in this set of prints is entirely in Latin underlining how they were aimed at an elite educated market. Listed are the titles, biblical quotations, details of the lcoations of the Cartoons and their sizes. Queen Anne had died while Dorigny was still at work. On the first of April 1719 Dorigny presented to King George I two sets of his newly completed prints of the Cartoons. On the 13th June 1720 Dorigny received a knighthood. He was the first of only two individuals in the history of British art to be knighted for having made particular prints. The other was Sir Robert Strange, knighted in 1787 for an engraving of Benjamin West's 'Apotheosis of the Princes Octavius and Alfred'.",victoria-and-albert-museum-london-uk,e; t; c; h,Height: 53.3 cm (sheet); Width: 74.5 cm (sheet); Height: 51.2 cm (platemark),https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O653438/,TRUE,FALSE

This print is in reverse of the cartoon. The Cartoons had been cut up into vertical strips, for reasons to do with the manufacture of tapestries, probably in Brussels. They were reassembled and put up on the walls of the King's Gallery at Hampton Court for the first time in June 1697. They were taken down again for part of 1699 to allow for alterations to the ceilings, doors and panelling, resulting in the arrangement seen in later prints by Gribelin. Their installation at Hampton Court marked their transformation from designs to be used in making tapestries into exhibited works of art. This print and its companion 'The Sacrifice at Lystra' (Dyce 2475) are the earliest prints which can truly be said to be ""of the Cartoons"". This print and its pair are the only two Cartoon prints which Audran executed before his death in 1703. According to George Vertue they were produced in Paris from copies of the Cartoons made by the painter Charles Jervas (ca. 1675-1739). These copies belonged to William III's Secretary at War in Ireland and Jervas' patron, George Clarke (1661-1736).

A stay in Florence between 1504 and 1508 was decisive for his artistic development as he changed significantly his manner while he became familiar with the works of the great Florentine masters such as Leonardo and Botticelli among others. He was later summoned to the papal court in Rome where he stayed until his death in 1520, decorating affresco the papal chambers in the Vatican and creating an impressive series of portraits and independent easel paintings of religious subject matters. Raphael had many pupils among whom the most notables were Giulio Romano, Perino del Vaga and Polidoro da Caravaggio. This painting is a copy after Raphael's Portrait of Giovanna of Aragon , the wife of Count Ascanio Colonna, Constable of the Kingdom of Naples. It shows the young woman lavishly dressed in a typical early 16th-century fashion with elements of a refined Renaissance palazzo's interior in the background.

This print is in reverse of the cartoon from which it is derived. The so-called Raphael Cartoons are seven full size designs for tapestries by the great Italian Renaissance artist Raphael (1483-1520). They illustrate passages from the Bible concerning the lives of Saint Peter and Saint Paul. None of them is smaller than ten feet high by thirteen feet wide. They belong to Her Majesty the Queen and have been on loan to this museum since 1865. The earliest print relating to the Raphael Cartoons dates from 1516, the year in which Raphael received final payment for the commission. It inaugurates an extraordinary case study in the history of printmaking, stretching over more than four hundred and fifty years and across a wide range of printmaking techniques. Nicholas Dorigny's prints were the subject of an editorial in the 'Spectator' on the 19th November 1711. ""These invaluable pieces are very justly in the Hands of the greatest and most pious sovereign in the World; and cannot be the frequent object of every one at their own leisure; but an engraver is to a painter, what a printer is to an author it is worthy Her Majesty's name, that she has encouraged that noble artist Monsieur Dorigny to publish these works of Raphael."" Writing in 1722 about the works of Raphael in Rome, Jonathan Richardson said ""That I should write upon what I never saw may appear strange to some; Such may please only to obeserve that My remarks are chiefly upon the way of thinking itself."" The engraver and antiquarian George Vertue had met and spoken with Dorigny. Vertue records that ""several gentlemen of note travelling to Rome there found Mr Dorigny who was then in the highest reputation for several engraved works after Raphael. These got him justly the reputation of the first engraver in Europe for which reason several Curious persons persuaded & engaged him to come to England to undertake those Famous Cartons at Hampton Court painted by Raphael...From his coming to England [in 1711] I may justly date the rise of the reputation of the engraving."" According to George Vertue, Dorigny acknowledged trying to imitate the great French engraver Gérard Audran when he was studying to improve his engraving style. The first proposal was that Dorigny engrave the Cartoons for the exclusive use of Queen Anne as presents for the nobility and visiting diplomats. Dorigny's price for the work of £4000-£5000 meant this idea was quashed and the prints were sold by subscription at four guineas a set. Dorigny was provided with limited royal patronage in the form of lodgings at Hampton Court, coals, and a bottle of wine a day. The lettering in this set of prints is entirely in Latin underlining how they were aimed at an elite educated market. Listed are the titles, biblical quotations, details of the lcoations of the Cartoons and their sizes. Queen Anne had died while Dorigny was still at work. On the first of April 1719 Dorigny presented to King George I two sets of his newly completed prints of the Cartoons. On the 13th June 1720 Dorigny received a knighthood. He was the first of only two individuals in the history of British art to be knighted for having made particular prints. The other was Sir Robert Strange, knighted in 1787 for an engraving of Benjamin West's 'Apotheosis of the Princes Octavius and Alfred'.",victoria-and-albert-museum-london-uk,e; t; c; h,Height: 53.8 cm (sheet); Width: 69 cm (sheet); Height: 51.4 cm (platemark); Width: 61.5 cm (platemark),https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O653441/,TRUE,FALSE

Orr's drawing is a copy - of sorts - of 'The Miraculous Draught of Fishes', one of the Raphael cartoons (which are themselves working drawings on a grand scale) - but he embellishes and animates his drawing with characteristically playful features such as the various fishes and sea-creatures which populate the foreground. The drawing works on several levels: it is not only a demonstration of an artist in dialogue with the art of the past, it also has strong links with the characteristic English tradition of caricature, and social and political satire - in the blackened and smoking buildings in the background Orr makes subtle allusions to the political climate at the time, in the light of the impending war (with Iraq) and the on-going war in Israel and the Occupied Territories, giving us a subtle subversion of our conventional view of the 'Holy Land'. It is also a splendid manifestation of drawing as an end in itself, rather than as something which stands in a preliminary or subordinate role to a work in another medium. The artist has given a fascinating account of the circumstances and experience of making this drawing: ""Thinking I only had 20 mins (luckily I had about 45 minutes in fact) to do my piece of the roll I decided to make it a sort of performance piece and practised until I knew the composition like a musical score and could rapidly re-make it.""",victoria-and-albert-museum-london-uk,C; o; l; u,Height: 120 cm; Width: 185 cm,https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O98313/,TRUE,FALSE

In 1505 Guidobaldo da Montefeltro, Duke of Urbino (ruled 1482-1508), commissioned Raphael, who was born in Urbino, to produce the painting. According to tradition, the Duke wanted it as a present for Henry VII of England (ruled 1485-1509). Henry had made him a member of the Order of the Garter, the highest order of English knighthood. By the time the print was made, in 1627, the painting had passed from the English Royal Collection to William Herbert, 3rd Earl of Pembroke (1580-1630). This print is dedicated to him. Subject Depicted St George was a legendary warrior saint and martyr who lived in the Near East at the end of the 3rd century AD. He is said to have slain a dragon outside the walls of a city in order to rescue the king's daughter, who was being offered as a sacrifice.

Having begun his professional career as an apprentice to a Sheffield engraver, and later worked for himself designing showcards and silverware, in 1843 Sykes enrolled at the newly-opened Sheffield School of Design. This was one of the government schools established to enable working craftsmen to learn the elements of design. Sykes was appointed assistant master at the school in 1856. His association with the Museum began in 1859 when he was recruited by Henry Cole to assist with the decorative schemes for the 1862 Exhibition (the successor to the Great Exhibition of 1851) and the new Horticultural Society's garden buildings. Sykes's use of terracotta for external decoration prompted the decision to use it for the new museum buildings. As John Physick notes, 'Sykes was so highly regarded that the Board decided that ""his views on questions of decoration [were] to be adopted in future.""' (Physick, p, 58.) Sykes went on to design elaborate decorative schemes for the principal parts of the new museum buildings: the North and South Courts and the Prince Consort's Gallery. Only three years before his own early death of a lung infection in 1866, Sykes designed the tomb in Kensal Green cemetery of another artist whose work was exceptionally well represented in the Museum's collections, William Mulready (1786-1863). Following his death, the South Kensington Museum held a memorial exhibition of his oil paintings, which included landscapes and genre scenes, and his architectural drawings. The Judgement of Solomon is a scaled-down oil replica of a ceiling fresco in the Vatican’s Stanze della Segnatura, painted by the great Renaissance master Raphael. It depicts the famous Biblical scene in which two women come to King Solomon in order to settle the dispute over who was the mother of a child. After Solomon orders the baby to be cut in half, one of the women agrees to give up the child, her reaction revealing her to be the true mother. Sykes also made a copy of Raphael’s Fall of Man , which appears in the same ceiling painting as The Judgement of Solomon . The purpose of Sykes’ copies is likely to have been educational, allowing art students in London proxy access to works by Renaissance artists. Like many other works by Sykes in the Museum’s collection, this painting was purchased the year after his death, following a retrospective exhibition.",victoria-and-albert-museum-london-uk,O; i; l; o,Height: 18 in (estimate); Width: 14.5 in (estimate),https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O134363/,TRUE,FALSE

According to Matthew, Christ asks Peter to care for his sheep and gives Peter the keys to his kingdom of Heaven, representing Peter's role of responsibility in the church and towards the faithful. The lake on the left is a visual continuation from the tapestry adjacent to it, the Miraculous Draught of Fishes. This print is in reverse of the cartoon from which it is derived. The so-called Raphael Cartoons, which this print reproduces, are seven full size designs for tapestries by the great Italian Renaissance artist Raphael (1483-1520). They illustrate passages from the Bible concerning the lives of Saint Peter and Saint Paul. None of them is smaller than ten feet high by thirteen feet wide. They belong to Her Majesty the Queen and have been on loan to this museum since 1865. The earliest print relating to the Raphael Cartoons dates from 1516, the year in which Raphael received final payment for the commission. It inaugurates an extraordinary case study in the history of printmaking, stretching over more than four hundred and fifty years and across a wide range of printmaking techniques. Simon Gribelin was the first printmaker to issue a complete set of prints of the Cartoons. When they came out in 1707 they carried a letterpress titlepage dedicating them to Queen Anne. Although they met with success it was nothing compared to that which greeted the set produced by Nicholas Dorigny in 1719. Gribelin was born in France but came to England around 1680. He was the most important silver engraver in London at the beginning of the eighteenth century. This meant engraving on the surfaces of watches, tea caddies, salvers etc. He was also a printmaker. In the 1690s he published two prints after history paintings by Charles Le Brun, then in 1706 he engraved an altar dish with a scene of the Deposition based on a picture by Annibale Carracci. These may have led to the idea of engraving the Cartoons. The antiquarian George Vertue wrote in his notebooks ""in London about 1700, the state of Print Engraving on Copper was at a low ebb… til about 1707. Mr Griblins cartons in print from the pictures of Raphael were well received, and vast numbers of them [sold]."" As well as visual information each print delivers written information in the form of a caption in English and Latin giving the title, the biblical reference, the names of the artist and the engraver, and stating the location of the Cartoons. Horace Walpole, writing in 1763, said of these prints ""their success was very great having never been completely engraved before; but they were too small a volume, nor had Gribelin anything of greatness in his manner or capacity: His works have no merit than finicalness, and that not in perfection, can give them."" Dr. Johnson defined finicialness as ""superfluous nicety or foppery"". Each of the individual engravings shows the Cartoon in reverse while the view of the Cartoon gallery shows them the right way round. In March 1735 Gribelin's son was selling sets of his late father's prints of the Cartoons for 15 shillings. By 1753 they had dropped to half a guinea (ten shillings and sixpence) in the price list of the print-publisher John Bowles. The following year in the catalogue of the print-publisher Henry Overton II, they were listed under ""Cheap Sets of Prints"".",victoria-and-albert-museum-london-uk,e; n; g; r,Height: 16 cm (plate); Width: 21 cm (plate),https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O950789/,TRUE,FALSE

This print is in reverse of the cartoon from which it is derived, and is therefore in the same direction as the tapestry. Nicholas Dorigny's prints were the subject of an editorial in the 'Spectator' on the 19th November 1711. ""These invaluable pieces are very justly in the Hands of the greatest and most pious sovereign in the World; and cannot be the frequent object of every one at their own leisure; but an engraver is to a painter, what a printer is to an author it is worthy Her Majesty's name, that she has encouraged that noble artist Monsieur Dorigny to publish these works of Raphael."" Writing in 1722 about the works of Raphael in Rome, Jonathan Richardson said ""That I should write upon what I never saw may appear strange to some; Such may please only to obeserve that My remarks are chiefly upon the way of thinking itself."" The engraver and antiquarian George Vertue had met and spoken with Dorigny. Vertue records that ""several gentlemen of note travelling to Rome there found Mr Dorigny who was then in the highest reputation for several engraved works after Raphael. These got him justly the reputation of the first engraver in Europe for which reason several Curious persons persuaded & engaged him to come to England to undertake those Famous Cartons at Hampton Court painted by Raphael...From his coming to England [in 1711] I may justly date the rise of the reputation of the engraving."" The first proposal was that Dorigny engrave the Cartoons for the exclusive use of Queen Anne as presents for the nobility and visiting diplomats. Dorigny's price for the work of £4000-£5000 meant this idea was quashed and the prints were sold by subscription at four guineas a set. Dorigny was provided with limited royal patronage in the form of lodgings at Hampton Court, coals, and a bottle of wine a day. The lettering in this set of prints is entirely in Latin underlining how they were aimed at an elite educated market. Listed are the titles, biblical quotations, details of the lcoations of the Cartoons and their sizes. Queen Anne had died while Dorigny was still at work. On the first of April 1719 Dorigny presented to King George I two sets of his newly completed prints of the Cartoons. On the 13th June 1720 Dorigny received a knighthood. He was the first of only two individuals in the history of British art to be knighted for having made particular prints. The other was Sir Robert Strange, knighted in 1787 for an engraving of Benjamin West's 'Apotheosis of the Princes Octavius and Alfred'.",victoria-and-albert-museum-london-uk,e; t; c; h,"Height: 51 cm (approx, trimmed); Width: 75.3 cm (approx, trimmed)",https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O1157432/,TRUE,FALSE

A l'origine, si l'on en croit l'inscription, cette allégorie des trois Arts, Peinture, Sculpture et Architecture, pleurant la mort de Raphaël, était destinée à illustrer un recueil de gravures d'après des dessins de Raphaël appartenant vraisemblablement à la reine Christine de Suède à laquelle la gravure d'Aquila a été dédiée ; Françoise Viatte dans Revue du Louvre, 1999, n° 3, p. 89, n° 16, repr.",louvre-museum-paris-france,"Plume et encre brune, lavis brun, sur traits à la sanguine, avec rehauts de gouache blanche, sur papier beige.

Inv. RF 1449) se traduisit par une suite de petits tableaux qu'il consacra au thème des amours du 'divin' peintre pour son modèle préféré, une belle boulangère. On compte au moins cinq tableaux sur ce thème, le premier en date (1813), conservé au musée de Riga, ayant disparu en 1941. Enlaçant son modèle, le maître se détourne de lui, comme s'il lui préférait son image peinte. Selon les versions, l'assistant du peintre, Jules Romain, apparaît ou non à l'arrière-plan ; c'est également le cas dans notre dessin. Ici, comme dans plusieurs des tableautins, apparaissent dans l'atelier des oeuvres célèbres de Raphaël : la 'Transfiguration' à l'extrême-droite, le 'Portrait de Baldassare Castiglione' en haut à droite et, en dessous, le 'tondo' de la 'Vierge à la chaise'. Daté de 1825, le dessin fut exécuté après le retour d'Ingres à Paris, et donné à son ami Coutan. Méjanès ('Petit Journal' de l'exposition 'Revoir Ingres', Paris, Louvre, 1980, p. 3) y voit comme un pendant, tracé ultérieurement, (du dessin Inv. RF 1449). Ingres avait aussi pensé à une composition où Raphaël, debout, appuyé sur l'épaule de sa maîtresse, en contemple le portrait (Vigne, 1995-2, nos 903 à 907 ; la figure de Raphaël y est posée par un modèle féminin).'

La dévotion à l'archange Raphaël, un des patrons de la ville de Cordoue, prit une importance particulière après la peste de 1649. Saint Raphaël aurait prononcé les paroles inscrites sur l'écusson, assurant sa protection sur la ville. A.E.

Des hachures disposées parallèlement reprises au lavis témoignent d'un travail régulier et réfléchi peu comparable à celui d'Ottavio.

He was just beginning *The Last Supper* mural for the Convent of Santa Maria delle Grazie. Inventor, artist, mathematician, naturalist, anatomist, engineer, and philosopher, Leonardo epitomized the quintessential Renaissance man. As a celebrated figure sought for important commissions, Leonardo worked for some of the most prominent families of Renaissance Europe, including the Medici of Italy and King Francis I of France. While he is now best known for works that celebrate notions of ideal human proportion and beauty, such as the *Vitruvian Man* and the *Mona Lisa*, his interest in physiognomy led him to seek out the full range of human expression and facial features. As the early artist-biographer Giorgio Vasari (1511-1574) recorded, Leonardo was ""so delighted when he saw curious heads, whether bearded or hairy, that he would follow anyone who had thus attracted his attention for a whole day, acquiring such a clear idea of him that when he went home he would draw the head as well as if the man had been present."" This *Caricature of a Man with Bushy Hair* was one of numerous drawings of exaggerated facial form that da Vinci called *visi monstruosi*, “monstrous faces” in English. They were eventually bequeathed to Leonardo’s pupil, Francesco Melzi, who made them available for other artists to study and copy. At some point late in the sixteenth century, this small sketch was cut from a larger single sheet of paper on which Leonardo had made multiple studies of heads. What remains here, though, carries hallmarks of Leonardo’s artistic technique. He used hatching—closely set parallel lines—to shade the figure. In this case, the strokes are drawn from the top left to lower right, a telltale sign of Leonardo’s renowned left-handedness (right-handed artists typically hatch from upper right to lower left, since the elbow is used as a pivot). The figure’s bushy hair reflects a technique that Leonardo pioneered and called *sfumato*, which relates to a softness of contour and blurring of boundaries, crucial to Leonardo’s style across drawings and paintings. He remarked that light and shade should blend “without lines or borders, in the manner of smoke.”",the-getty-los-angeles-us,,Height: 6.6 cm; Width: 5.4 cm; Sort Number: 84 647 Numbers,https://www.getty.edu/art/collection/object/103QXS,TRUE,FALSE

Often these pages contained a scattering of sketches on numerous unrelated projects, seemingly the contents of Leonardo’s thoughts poured onto the page. This sheet includes studies for a child with a lamb (on the *recto*, or front) and studies of machinery (on the *verso*, or back, or reverse), among other sketches. With limited formal schooling, Leonardo learned through close observation and an insatiable curiosity about how things worked. Between 1503 and 1506, Leonardo used black chalk, pen and ink to draw a child and a lamb multiple times, trying out different poses for the figures. He began with many quick sketches in chalk. He then went over some of these in pen and ink, firming up his ideas, as at upper right. The most evolved study is that at center left, in which the child leans back on the lamb, the group rendered more completely in space. Sheets of drawings such as this allowed Renaissance artists to experiment with complex compositions, poses, gestures, and expressions before committing them to wood panel or canvas with paint. As such, drawings were rarely meant to be viewed as finished objects in their own right. Leonardo probably made the drawing in preparation for a painting of the *Virgin and Child with Saint John*, now lost but known through copies. He inscribed some unrelated notes concerning a treatise on geometry at the top of the sheet in his characteristic backwards writing, legible only with the help of a mirror. Some speculated that this right-to-left writing was meant to conceal his ideas, but this is not in fact any kind of da Vinci code. Because he was left-handed, writing in the opposite direction saved Leonardo from smearing ink as his hand moved across the paper. Mirror-writing such as this is often found in left-handed children before they are “corrected.” Leonardo was also an accomplished inventor and engineer, with a detailed knowledge of cranes, levers, pulleys, and gears, and sketches of machinery and parts are seen on the verso side of this sheet. A design for a press or early laminating machine, the adjacent notes concern the wear and tear on the machine, particularly the axel, and a possible solution: a replaceable axel. Some of Leonardo’s more ambitious conceptions, including early thinking about the possibility of tanks, helicopters, submarines, and other military weapons, were never realized in his time.",the-getty-los-angeles-us,,Height: 21 cm; Width: 14.1 cm; Sort Number: 86 725 Numbers,https://www.getty.edu/art/collection/object/103QS0,TRUE,FALSE

In 1642 a German soldier Ludwig von Siegen (ca. 1609–ca. 1680) developed a spiked roulette wheel, which could be run over the metal plate to make the process of stippling easier and quicker. The method became prevalent during the following century. Stipple images were usually printed in colour, with red being the most common. The stippling wheel could be used either directly on the plate to create a series of small pits in the metal or with the etching print process by being run through etching ground exposing the metal, which was then etched. When printed, the resultant image was composed of dots. It could be touched up with line work where needed. It is possible to tell an engraved stipple image from the etched versions by looking at the shape of the dots through a magnifier; more regular triangular shapes were created in the engraved method, while the etched dots were less well defined, since they were bitten by acid.

He was in Milan from ca. 1482 and 1499 and was back in Florence in 1500, where he remained until 1508. Leonardo went back to Milan in 1508 until 1513. He then went to Rome to work under the patronage of Giuliano de' Medici, Duc de Nemours. At some point between 1516 and 1517, Leonardo went to France where he was accommodated by the King Francis I at the manor house of Clos-Lucé, Amboise. He died in this house in 1519.

A chromolithograph is produced by applying the design to be printed onto a stone with a greasy chalk. The surface of the stone is then moistened. As grease and water do not combine, the parts already drawn upon repel the water and the untouched parts absorb it. Greasy ink is passed over the surface. The wet parts reject the ink while the greasy parts attract it. The paper on which the image is to be printed is placed on the surface and together they are passed through a press. One stone is used for each colour. This print was produced for the Arundel Society. The subjects, to be reproduced for subscribers to the Society, were chosen by a council who favoured Italian decorative and narrative fresco cycles of the 14th, 15th and 16th centuries. Artists were employed to copy these works of art. The watercolours they produced were examined and selected by the council and then forwarded to the printers.

Le Louvre conserve de nombreux dessins préparatoires pour ce tableau (entres autres : RF 35350 à RF 35390). La commande pour la décoration de l'hémicycle de la salle des Prix dans le nouveau bâtiment de l'Ecole des beaux-arts à Paris est confiée à Delaroche par Adolphe Thiers en septembre 1836. Elle fut achevée en juillet 1841. Le projet de Delaroche s'inscit dans la vision d'ensemble de l'établissement, avec Duban à l'architecture et Peisse à la sculpture et répond à la volonté de rénover les études artistiques en élargissant le champ des références historiques. Delaroche était membre de l'Académie des beaux-arts, professeur à l'Ecole et partie prenante de cette modernisation de l'enseignement. Le mur courbe mesure 3,90 mètres de haut sur 24,70 mètres de long, soit en longueur près de cinq fois 'L'Apothéose d'Homère' d'Ingres et près de quatre fois 'L'Ecole d'Athènes' de Raphaël au Vatican qui apparaissent comme les prototypes les plus évidents. Delaroche ne voulait pas représenter l'art uniquement sous forme allégorique mais aussi, sous la protection incontestée des maîtres de l'Antiquité, les artistes de la période gothique à l'âge classique. Les différentes disciplines enseignées à l'Ecole (peinture, sculpture et architecture) devait aussi figurer. 'L'Hémicycle' de Delaroche apparait comme un manifeste esthétique de l'éclectisme des artistes des années romantiques (Claude Allemand-Cosneau in cat. d'exp. ""Paul Delaroche, un peintre dans l'Histoire"", Paris, Nantes, Montpellier, éditions de la RNM, musée des Beaux-Arts, musée Fabre, 1999, p.105 à p.129). La modernité des visages des modèles qui ont posé pour des artistes qui ne leur ressemblent pas contraste avec leurs costumes d'époque. Il existe une autre étude de Fra Angelico, plus complète, conservée au Louvre (RF 35316) avec un manteau différent. Delaroche traite les draperies avec une particulière habileté, usant tour à tour de l'estompe et de fermes accents pour marquer certains plis (L.-A. Prat in cat. d'exp. 'Paul Delaroche', Paris, musée du Louvre, 2012, n°42).",louvre-museum-paris-france,"Estompe, mine de plomb et lavis sur papier beige.

Reiset, Paris, Louvre, Cabinet des Dessins) à la suite de l'identification du monogramme de cet artiste sur la feuille 'BP' faite par D. Cordellier (communication orale). Comme suggéré par Paul Joannides (2003), ce dessin évoque la 'Sainte Anne' de Léonard de Vinci (Paris, musée du Louvre, département des Peintures, Inv. 776) et semble indiquer que l'artiste avait connaissance des études préparatoires à l'œuvre (voir au Louvre, RF 460 ; Londres, The British Museum, inv. 1875,0612.17). Selon Dominique Cordellier (dans Joannides, 2003, p. 398 sous n° R25), Pupini pourrait avoir tracé ce dessin à partir d'un modèle sculpté non identifié sans doute celui d'un artiste connu sous le nom de Maitre des 'Enfants turbulents' ou 'mal élevés' (Giovanni Francesco Rustici ?), actif à Florence entre 1515 et 1530. L'on connait en particulier une terre cuite de l'artiste qui présente un lien étroit avec la Sainte Anne de Leonard (New York, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, inv. 1986.156.2).

In 1969, the scholar Robert P. Welsh suggested that this sheet was linked to a series of compositions Mondrian made around 1914, based on the facade of a church in the town of Domburg, the Netherlands. This drawing has appeared in an exhibition at The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in 1971, and was previously in the collections of artists Yves Tanguy (1900-1955) and Leon Kelly (born 1901). Nevertheless, 20th-century art-including works by Modigliani and Matisse, for example-has been a popular target of forgers, and Mondrian's authorship of this drawing will continue to be the subject of disagreement.",art-institute-of-chicago-us,"Charcoal, with erasing, on off-white laid paper",63.3 × 48.3 cm (24 15/16 × 19 1/16 in.),https://www.artic.edu/artworks/28634,FALSE,FALSE

However, it is nearly impossible to establish when the drawing was made or whether the drawing or painting came first. Prior to 1908, Piet Mondrian rarely dated his work; moreover, his artistic evolution is hard to trace chronologically since he made two kinds of work simultaneously: formally experimental landscapes and—forced by his meager finances to appeal to buyers—naturalistic scenes. Based on stylistic similarities to other works of that time, Robert Welsh, a scholar of Mondrian’s early work, dated the sheet to around 1905.",art-institute-of-chicago-us,Fabricated charcoal on blue laid paper,46.8 × 62.3 cm (18 7/16 × 24 9/16 in.),https://www.artic.edu/artworks/88464,FALSE,FALSE

He reduced bridges, churches, rivers, trees, and more to a series of horizontal and vertical black lines enclosing fields of unmixed red, blue, and yellow as well as white, black, and gray. This artistic idiom, eventually called Neoplasticism, removed naturalism from painting to reveal the essence of visual forms and provide viewers with a transcendental experience. While Mondrian’s abstractions may seem simple, he worked hard to achieve the dynamic yet harmonious balance between line and color. He labored over the location, spacing, and thickness of every line, making numerous charcoal sketches both on paper and directly on the canvas. Although not immediately related to any finished painting, Study for a Composition shows the artist’s obsession with the density and placement of line and the number, size, and location of color fields. Here, he collaged red and blue papers to the sheet to examine their weight and position in relation to other elements.

Even after he began to create his better-known abstract work, he still made more salable scenes in order to support himself. Since it bears stylistic similarities to his late-19th-century work, the watercolor probably predates 1900. The Amsterdam skyline appears from the west, as it does often in his pictures from that time. Although the scene is filled with lifelike details, Mondrian seemed to have delighted in the rhythmic placement of the trees.

The viewpoint was taken from a hill in the foreground, looking south, with the gently rolling fields receding into the valley. The city of Arnhem, with the steeple of St. Martin's Church, can be seen in the hazy distance at left. The high horizon line, the elaborately worked surface, and the pattern of light and dark planes of color are characteristic of the landscapes Mondrian made around 1900 to 1902. Applying blue and green translucent watercolors and opaque watercolors wet-into-wet, Mondrian used the aqueous tidelines to create a dreamlike landscape that emits a tranquil spirituality. Landscape near Arnhem is suggestive of the artist's writings in which he describes his ""search in nature for truth"" and his ""need to abstract everything"" until he reached ""the foundations of things."" The clear structuring of Landscape near Arnhem in the grid of the fields and flattened planar surfaces underscore Mondrian's early interest in the underlying foundations of nature, which he would later develop into the radical geometric abstractions for which he is renowned.",the-getty-los-angeles-us,,Height: 52 cm; Width: 74.77 cm; Depth: 3.5 cm; Height: 87 cm,https://www.getty.edu/art/collection/object/109Q5Q,TRUE,FALSE

Titian and his workshop created many copies and variations of this composition, at least seven of which are known today. This work is likely to have been executed with some workshop assistance. In this variation, the artist omits the skull which appears in other compositions, and instead depicts the Magdalene's Bible resting on a cloth-covered support. Such minor alterations to compositions were often made at the request of a patron, who wanted a work similar to one which already existed, but unique in some way. The sacrament of Penance had important significance in Counter-Reformation spirituality, and artists frequently portrayed penitent saints as exemplars of religious fervor. Such works were meant to inspire a greater devotion at a time when Catholicism was being challenged by Protestant reform. On the other hand, the popularity of The Magdalene as a subject is also associated with her implied sexuality. Her passive gaze and partially naked body appealed to male viewers, for whom such paintings offered a moralizing context through which to engage with the sensuality of the female form. The Magdalene’s partly exposed breasts and long, flowing hair, would have held erotic connotations for the sixteenth-century viewer. Upon encountering one of Titian’s conceptions of the Penitent Magdalene, biographer Giorgio Vasari (1511–1574) denied such sexual undertones, and declared that the picture “profoundly stirs the emotions of all who look at it; and, moreover, although the figure Mary Magdalene is extremely lovely it moves one to thoughts of pity rather than desire.” X-rays of the painting reveal that the artist made numerous changes to the composition, known as pentimenti, suggesting that the composition was developed and altered during its execution.",the-getty-los-angeles-us,"Oil Paint (Paint), Canvas (Textile Material)",Height: 108.27 cm; Width: 94.3 cm; Depth: 9.21 cm; Height: 138.75 cm,https://www.getty.edu/art/collection/object/103R9F,TRUE,FALSE

She clings to him, imploring him not to go, but Adonis looks down at her impassively.

Cupid sleeps in the background, a symbol of Adonis's resistance to Venus's entreaties, since his ineffective arrows hang uselessly in a tree. The story ends tragically; during the hunt, the mortal Adonis is fatally gored by a wild boar. Titian's loose, energetic brushstrokes give the painting a sense of spontaneity and movement. In some areas, as in Adonis’s arm, the artist even painted with his finger.

His work marks the transition from the 15th-century tradition characterised by meticulous finish and the use of bright local colours to the 16th century interest in a broader technique, with less defined outlines and more congruous colouring. Although based in Venice, Titian received commissions for royal and noble patrons outside Venice and Italy, notably for Philip II of Spain and his works had a formative influence on major European painters of the 17th century, including Rubens and Velázquez. CAI.97 appears to be a 16th century copy of Titian's painting of ca. 1521-23 in the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna of roughly the same dimensions. The Vienna picture is recorded as in the home of Zuan Antonio Venier in Venice in 1528 and in the collection of Bartolomeo della Nave in the same city by 1648, suggesting that the V&A copy was painted there around this time. However, the V&A picture lacks the luminescent colouring, skilled handling of light and the same attention to detail visible in Titian's original. There are also some differences in the facial expression of the youth.

The identification of the scene with Bacchus is supported by the crown of vine leaves worn by the young man and his mane of blond hair, also visible in Titian's representation of the god in the Bacchus and Ariadne (London, National Gallery, NG35).

Titian and his workshop represented the penitent Magdalen in the desert, with her long auburn hair scarcely hiding her nakedness, on many occasions throughout his career from about 1535 onwards. The Magdalen is generally identified with the penitent harlot described in Luke (7:36 ff) who wept tears and wetted Christ's feet which she then wiped with her hair, kissed and anointed. One legend describes her as retreating into a grotto at Sainte-Baume in France as suggested by the cave in Dyce.42.

artwork_0004903,The Presentation of the Virgin in the Temple (after Titian),titian,painting,ca. 1840 - 1875,"https://framemark.vam.ac.uk/collections/2007BP0868/full/843,/0/default.jpg","The sculptor and designer Alfred George Stevens was born in Blandford Forum on 31st December 1817. He spent nine formative years in Italy, travelling there in 1833 at the age of sixteen. There he studied Renaissance painting, copying frescoes in Florence and the works of Andrea del Sarto at Naples, and sketching at Pompeii. He received some formal training at the Accademia di Belle Arti in Florence. Later, in 1841-2, he worked in Rome as an assistant to the major neo-classical sculptor Bertel Thorvaldsen. In 1845, following his return to England, he was appointed as an instructor in painting and ornament at the Government School of Design at Somerset House, where he taught architectural drawing, perspective, modelling and ornamental painting. He remained in this post for just over two years, when he resigned, being, as he put it, ‘heartily sick of it.’ In 1850 he became chief designer to a Sheffield firm, Messrs. Hoole and Robson, who specialised in metalwork and won renown for metalwork exhibited at the Great Exhibition of 1851. In 1856 Stevens received two major commissions that would occupy him until his death in 1875. The first was to conceive a decorative scheme for the dining room of Dorchester House in London for Robert Stayner Holford and the second was to design and execute a monument to the Duke of Wellington which was to have a permanent place in St Paul’s Cathedral. The major piece that was executed (although never finished) by Stevens for Dorchester House’s dining room was the chimneypiece. This was finished after Stevens’ death by his former pupil James Gamble and is now in the Gamble Room at the Victoria and Albert Museum. The Wellington Monument was worked on by Stephens until A. S. Ayrton, the first commissioner of works, ended his contract in 1870. This unresolved situation and Stevens’ sudden death on 1st May 1875 meant that he never finished the monument. His pupil Hugh Stannus completed the majority of the work, but it was only finally finished in 1912 after several petitions from prominent artists including Frederic Leighton, and after further work had been carried out by John Tweed. This painting of the Presentation of the Virgin at the Temple is a scaled down replica of Titian’s original, at the Gallerie dell'Accademia, Venice. It depicts a scene not from the New Testament but the apocryphal Gospel of James in which Mary, Mother of Jesus is brought to the Temple of Jerusalem by her parents in thanks to God for having gifted them a child. Stevens travelled and worked in Italy from 1833 until his return to England in 1842 during which time he would likely have seen Titian’s original. This painting was acquired by the museum in 1881 as an example of the work of the Old Masters for art students of the time. The V&A’s collection includes other nineteenth century replicas such as Godfrey Sykes’ copies of Velasquez’s Adoration of the Shepherds , Raphael’s Judgement of Solomon and Titian’s Venus of Urbino .",victoria-and-albert-museum-london-uk,O; i; l; o,Height: 22.875 in (estimate); Width: 50 in (estimate),https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O124098/,TRUE,FALSE

But from the late 1620s Peter Oliver (possibly born in 1594, died 1647) also painted subject pictures in miniature. These are called 'Histories in limning' (limning was the traditional word for miniature) in Edward Norgate's treatise on miniature painting, entitled Miniatura; or, The Art of Limning . Norgate (born in the 1580s, died 1650) was a contemporary of Oliver. People As Norgate explained in his treatise, such subject miniatures were unknown in England until 'of late years it pleased a most excellent King to command...some of his own pieces, of Titian...to be translated into English limning, which indeed were admirably performed by his Servant, Mr Peter Oliver'. Charles I (ruled 1625-1649) was a great connoisseur and collector. He had a magnificent collection of oil paintings. His command to have them copied in miniature reflects the value he placed on both his collection and miniature painting, a highly prized and exquisite watercolour art. Ownership & Use Charles I (1625-1649) employed the Dutch wax-modeller Abraham van der Doort (born around 1575-1580, died 1640) to look after his collection of paintings. This copy by Oliver after a painting by Titian (born around 1485, died 1576) was a highly prized object and stored as such. Van der Doort recorded for Charles that it was 'kept in your new cabinet room within your cupboards...at Whitehall'. Here, it was one of ten miniatures kept in 'double shutting cases with locks and keys and glasses over them'. Titian's original oil painting, of which this is a copy, survives in a private collection in Rome. This miniature matches the description of the Titian in the inventory of Charles I's collection.

It was probably there that he met Joseph-Étienne Roulin, a mail handler who became his close friend as well as an important subject for his paintings. Between July 1888 and April 1889, Van Gogh painted six portraits of Roulin (as well as several of Roulin's wife and children). In each, Roulin wears his dark blue uniform, with the word ""Postes"" clearly legible across his hat. Clothing plays a central role in this series, describing not only the sitter's occupation but also perhaps his political leanings; as an ardent socialist, he would have worn his worker identity proudly. Moreover, the uniform announces that portraiture is no longer reserved for the upper class. Roulin is shown here from the shoulders up, his body centered and perfectly square to the picture plane. His gaze is steady yet gentle. In contrast to the symmetry of the composition, his features are slightly uneven: the nose is lopsided and the eyes are too, an irregularity that is accentuated by the heavier touches of red around one eyelid. The mustache hangs in uneven clumps over his lips. All these details add to the naturalism of Roulin's face, which is even more striking for the picture's many decorative qualities. In The Postman , one of the first works to enter Albert Barnes's collection, Van Gogh turns an ordinary salt-and-pepper beard into a brilliant ocean of color. Thick licks of paint—green, black, purple, red—curl around one another, each stroke distinct and unblended; in a few areas the bare canvas can be glimpsed between them.

In February 1888, Van Gogh departed from Paris for Arles in southern France, where he planned to live and work together with fellow painters.

This Sunflowers was painted while Van Gogh was waiting for Gauguin’s arrival with the purpose of decorating his room. The Sunflowers , which is now in our collection, must have been painted between late November and early December that year, when Van Gogh and Gauguin lived together, and it was based on the first Sunflowers on Yellow Background , painted in August 1888, and now in the collection of the National Gallery in London. Though the basic color and composition of the Tokyo version is the same as that in London, the brush strokes and color tones of these two paintings are slightly different.

Hier zeigt er den Krankensaal vom Hospital seiner Wahlheimat. 1888 war der Niederländer zum Arbeiten in die südfranzösische Provinzstadt Arles gekommen. Zum Ende des Jahres wurde er nach mehreren Zusammenbrüchen in das örtliche Krankenhaus eingewiesen. Als Künstler erfasste er, was er als Patient dort sah. Der langgestreckte Saal mit der flachen Decke und den aufgereihten Krankenlagern löst Beklommenheit aus. Die Mitpatienten, die sich um den Ofen versammelt haben, wirken dagegen ruhig und gelassen. Diese Ambivalenz findet sich auch in dem Werk «Der Innenhof des Hospitals von Arles» (SOR1922.11) aus der Sammlung Oskar Reinhart «Am Römerholz», das Van Gogh ebenfalls dort begann.; SOR1925.12",oskar-reinhart-collection-am-romerholz-winterthur-switzerland,Oil on canvas,72 x 91 cm,https://www.bundessammlungen.ch/en/collection/item/11379/,FALSE,FALSE

Die Patienten können sich zwar an der freien Luft bewegen, jedoch nur in dem von Bogengängen begrenzten Innenhof. Die blühenden Blumenbeete kontrastieren mit den kargen, düsteren Bäumen; der Himmel ist nicht sichtbar. Der Maler verbrachte den Beginn des Jahres 1889 in dieser Einrichtung, nachdem er sich bei einem Anfall Teile seines linken Ohrs abgeschnitten hatte. Trotz schwerer gesundheitlicher Probleme nutzte er die Zeit künstlerisch.
