Born in Calcutta and raised in the verdant Himalayan mountains of Kashmir, Shaw draws deeply on the landscapes and memories of his early life, many of which were fractured by political upheaval. Forced to leave Kashmir as a teenager, he relocated first to New Delhi and later to London, where he studied at Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design.
His work is influenced by a broad range of sources—Mughal and Persian miniatures, Renaissance altarpieces, Old Masters paintings, Japanese arts of the Momoyama period, Kashmiri and Urdu poetry, and Hindu and Western mythology—and yet his visual vocabulary and technique are all his own."

When he was just 14, he made a drawing entitled “A Japanese Residence” (1918), and several early watercolors from the 1920s depict Asian scenes. Goff deeply engaged with Japanese art and culture throughout his life, collecting prints alongside his patron Joe Price, and finally visiting the country in 1969."

In 2024 architects Ivi Diamantopoulou and Jaffer Kolb of the firm New Affiliates were invited to participate in the Beta Architecture Biennial in Timișoara, Romania. Already steeped in Bruce Goff’s architectural drawings and collections for their exhibition design of the upcoming retrospective Bruce Goff: Material Worlds, they decided to take a deep dive into his unique forms and materialities. This new creative project soon focused on three of Goff’s best-known works: Shin’enKan, a house for Etsuko and Joe Price in Bartlesville, Oklahoma; the Ruth and Sam Ford House in Aurora, Illinois; and the Eugene and Nancy Bavinger House in Norman, Oklahoma."

The large-scale installation will be in the museum’s Brotman Forum, its main entrance lobby and a community space that is free to the public to enjoy without a ticket to the museum. The commission was organized by José Carlos Diaz, SAM’s Susan Brotman Deputy Director for Art.
Little Cloud Sky (2025) is composed of 40 of the artists’ signature Little Cloud character, each custom made of plastic, four feet wide, and suspended from the ceiling of the Brotman Forum. The work is designed to spread positivity and inspire a sense of connection, encouraging museum visitors to reflect on the beauty of togetherness and the power of joy and nature. While versions of this interior skyscape have been displayed in cities around the world, including Las Vegas, Miami, Tokyo, and London, this is a brand-new iteration and the artists’ first long-term museum installation.
The Little Cloud character serves as a symbol of peace and connectivity and can be found throughout the artists’ work. In August 2024, London’s Covent Garden featured Little Cloud World, an installation with 40 inflatable Little Cloud characters. In January 2024, Tokyo’s Yoyogi Park hosted Little Cloud Sky, accompanied by a large-scale parade, “The Happy Dancing Rainbow Alliance,” featuring FriendsWithYou’s iconic characters."

An in-depth exploration of Islamic architecture, art, and identity, this is the first solo exhibition of a Pakistani American artist in SAM’s 90-year history.

This reinterpretation of Claude Monet’s iconic triptych from the Museum of Modern Art in New York offers an equally immersive experience, merging the lush beauty of Monet’s water lilies with Ai’s personal history.
Visitors can experience this work—displayed in one long panel on a single wall—up close in an intimate gallery at the Seattle Asian Art Museum. This is the first time this work has been shown in the US; it debuted in 2023 at the Berlin art gallery neugerriemschneider.
The piece has a connection with the Seattle Art Museum’s history. An actual Monet Water Lilies work was loaned to the museum in 1956 by Walter P. Chrysler Jr., who purchased it from the Monet estate and toured it around the United States. The painting was displayed in the Fuller Garden Court of the Seattle Asian Art Museum, the original home of the Seattle Art Museum."

The association of these creatures with the Chinese calendar began in the third century BCE and became firmly established by the first century CE. The twelve animals are, in sequence: rat, ox, tiger, rabbit, dragon, snake, horse, ram, monkey, rooster, dog, and pig. Each is believed to embody certain traits that are manifested in the personalities of people born in that year. January 29, 2025, marks the beginning of the Year of the Snake, a creature characterized as alert, calm, and smart.
Celebrating the Year of the Snake presents a remarkable selection of works drawn from the Museum’s collection illustrating the significant role that the snake plays in Chinese culture, including a 3,000-year-old bronze ritual vessel with a spout formed by joined snakes’ heads, a 13th-century pottery figure of a mischievously smiling snake, and an 18th-century exquisitely painted porcelain cup portraying a scene from the “Legend of the White Snake,” a popular folktale of love and romance between humans and fantastic creatures.
The exhibition is made possible by the Joseph Hotung Fund."
